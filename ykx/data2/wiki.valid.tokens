 The Americans knew of the approach of the Japanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols , but did not know exactly where or when they would attack . The ridge around which <unk> deployed his men consisted of three distinct <unk> . At the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was Hill 80 ( so named because it rose 80 ft ( 24 m ) above sea level ) . Six hundred yards north was Hill 123 ( 123 ft ( 37 m ) high ) , the dominant feature on the ridge . The <unk> <unk> was unnamed and about 60 ft ( 18 m ) high . <unk> placed the five companies from the <unk> battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three Parachute battalion companies on the east side , holding positions in depth from Hill 80 back to Hill 123 . Two of the five <unk> companies , " B " and " C " , held a line between the ridge , a small , swampy <unk> , and the <unk> River . Machine @-@ gun teams from " E " Company , the heavy weapons company , were scattered throughout the defenses . <unk> placed his command post on Hill 123 . 
 At 21 : 30 on 12 September , the Japanese cruiser <unk> and three destroyers shelled the <unk> perimeter for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a <unk> . Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines , but did little damage . At the same time , scattered groups of <unk> 's troops began <unk> with Marines around the ridge . <unk> 's 1st Battalion — led by Major <unk> <unk> — attacked the <unk> 's " C " company between the <unk> and the <unk> River , overrunning at least one platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge . <unk> 's unit became entangled with troops from <unk> 's 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel <unk> <unk> , who were still struggling to reach their attack positions , and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night . <unk> , who was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops ' attacks , later complained , " Due to the <unk> jungle , the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control . In my whole life I have never felt so disappointed and helpless . " Twelve U.S. Marines were killed ; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater . Although both <unk> in the west and the <unk> unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night , they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn . 
 At first light on 13 September , <unk> Air Force aircraft and Marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge , forcing any Japanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle . The Japanese suffered several casualties , including two officers from <unk> 's battalion . At 05 : 50 , <unk> decided to regroup his forces for another attack that night . 
 
 = = = Second night 's action on the ridge = = = 
 
 <unk> the Japanese to attack again that night , <unk> directed his troops to improve their defenses on and around the ridge . After a failed attempt by two companies to retake the ground on the Marine right flank lost to <unk> the night before , <unk> <unk> his forces . He pulled his front back about 400 yd ( 370 m ) to a line that stretched 1 @,@ 800 yd ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) , starting at the <unk> River and crossing the ridge about 150 yd ( 140 m ) south of Hill 123 . Around and behind Hill 123 he placed five companies . Any Japanese attackers <unk> Hill 80 would have to advance over 400 yd ( 370 m ) of open terrain to close with the Marine positions at Hill 123 . With only a few hours to prepare , the Marines were only able to construct rudimentary and shallow fortifications . They were low on ammunition , with one or two grenades for each Marine . <unk> ordered a reserve force consisting of the 2nd Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment ( 2 / 5 ) to move into a position just to the rear of <unk> 's troops . In addition , a battery of four <unk> howitzers from the 11th Marine Regiment moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge , and a forward artillery observer was placed with <unk> 's front line units . 
 Late in the afternoon , <unk> stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops , saying , 
 You men have done a great job , and I have just one more thing to ask of you . <unk> out just one more night . I know we 've been without sleep a long time . But we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here . I have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning . 
 <unk> 's speech " raised the spirits " of the Raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead . 
 As the sun set on 13 September , <unk> faced <unk> 's 830 Marines with 3 @,@ 000 troops of his brigade , plus an assortment of light artillery . The night was pitch black , with no moon . At 21 : 00 , seven Japanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge . <unk> 's attack began just after nightfall , with <unk> 's battalion assaulting <unk> Company B on the Marine right flank , just to the west of the ridge . The force of the assault caused Company B to fall back to Hill 123 . Under Marine artillery fire , <unk> reassembled his men and continued his attack . Without <unk> to try to " roll @-@ up " the other nearby Marine units , whose flanks were now unprotected , <unk> 's unit <unk> forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the <unk> River , heading for the airfield . <unk> 's men came upon a pile of Marine supplies and rations . Not having eaten adequately for a couple of days , they paused to " <unk> themselves " on the " C " and " K " rations . <unk> ordered his men to continue the attack . At about 03 : 00 , he led them against the Marine units around the northern portion of the ridge , just short of the airfield , as well as Hill 123 . In the heavy fighting that followed , <unk> and around 100 of his men were killed , ending that attack . 
 Meanwhile , <unk> 's 2nd Battalion , under Major <unk> Tamura , assembled for their planned assault against Hill 80 from the jungle south of the ridge . Marine observers spotted Tamura 's preparations and called in artillery fire . At about 22 : 00 , a barrage from twelve 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns hit Tamura 's position . In response , two companies of Tamura 's troops — numbering about 320 men — charged up Hill 80 with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades . Tamura 's attack hit Company B of the Marine Parachute battalion and also <unk> Company B , pushing the <unk> off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the <unk> . To protect the exposed <unk> Company B , <unk> immediately ordered them to pull back onto Hill 123 . 
 At the same time , a Japanese company from <unk> 's battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and Parachute Company C. <unk> that their positions were now <unk> , Parachute Companies B and C climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind Hill 123 . In the darkness and confusion of the battle , the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized . A few Marines began <unk> that the Japanese were attacking with poison gas , <unk> other Marines who no longer possessed their gas masks . After arriving behind Hill 123 , some of the Marines continued on towards the airfield , repeating the word " withdraw " to anyone within <unk> . Other Marines began to follow them . Just at the moment that it appeared that the Marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a <unk> , <unk> , Major Kenneth D. Bailey from <unk> 's staff , and other Marine officers appeared and , with " vivid " language , <unk> the Marines back into defensive positions around Hill 123 . 
 As the Marines formed into a <unk> @-@ shaped line around Hill 123 , Tamura 's battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill , charging up the saddle from Hill 80 and up from below the east side of the ridge . Under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one Japanese <unk> , the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura 's men . Tamura 's troops <unk> a 75 mm ( 2 @.@ 95 in ) " regimental " gun to the top of Hill 80 in an effort to fire it directly at the Marines . This gun , which " could have turned the tide in favor of the Japanese , " however , was disabled by a faulty firing pin . At midnight , during a short lull in the fighting , <unk> ordered Parachute Companies B and C to advance from behind Hill 123 to strengthen his left flank . With fixed bayonets , the <unk> swept forward , killing Japanese soldiers who had overrun the Marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the Marine lines from the flank , and took position on the east side of the hill . Marines from other units , as well as members of <unk> 's command staff , including Major Bailey , took ammunition and grenades under fire to the Marines around Hill 123 , who were running critically low . Said Marine participant Captain William J. <unk> , " The Japanese attack was almost constant , like a rain that <unk> for a moment and then <unk> the harder ... When one wave was <unk> down - and I mean <unk> down - another followed it into death . " 
 The Japanese hit <unk> 's left flank just after the <unk> took position but were again stopped by Marine rifle , machine @-@ gun , mortar , and grenade fire . Marine 105 mm and 75 mm artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking Japanese . A captured Japanese soldier later said that his unit was " annihilated " by the Marine artillery fire , which only 10 % of his company survived . 
 By 04 : 00 , after <unk> several more assaults , some of which resulted in hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting , and severe sniper fire from all sides , <unk> 's men were joined by troops from the 2nd Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment , who helped repulse two more Japanese attacks before dawn . Throughout the night , as <unk> 's men came close to overrunning the Marine defenses , <unk> remained standing about 20 yd ( 18 m ) behind the Marine firing line on Hill 123 , <unk> his troops and directing their defensive efforts . Said Marine Captain <unk> Smith , who was in position to observe <unk> for most of the night , " I can say that if there is such a thing as one man holding a battalion together , <unk> did it that night . He stood just behind the front lines – stood , when most of us <unk> the ground . " 
 During the heavy fighting , portions of three Japanese companies , including two from Tamura 's and one from <unk> 's battalions , <unk> the Marine defenses on the ridge , while suffering heavy losses from Marine gunfire , and reached the edge of " Fighter One " , a secondary runway of Henderson Field . A counterattack by the Marine engineers stopped one Japanese company 's advances and forced it to retreat . The other two companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield . When no reinforcements joined them , both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after <unk> . Most of the rest of <unk> 's battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night . 
 As the sun rose on 14 September , pockets of Japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge . But with Tamura 's battalion shattered after losing <unk> of its officers and men , and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well , <unk> 's assault on the ridge had effectively ended . About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80 , perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123 . At first light , three U.S. Army aircraft from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field , acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey , <unk> the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them , with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle . 
 
 = = = <unk> and <unk> attacks = = = 
 
 As the battle on the ridge took place , <unk> 's <unk> and <unk> units also attacked the Marine defenses on the east and west sides of the <unk> perimeter . The <unk> battalion — led by Major Takeshi <unk> — attacked the southeastern sector of the <unk> perimeter , defended by Marines of the 3rd Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment ( 3 / 1 ) . <unk> 's attack started around midnight , with one company attacking through Marine artillery fire and engaging in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat with the Marine defenders before being thrown back . <unk> was killed in the attack . After <unk> , the Marines , believing that the rest of <unk> 's battalion was still in the area , sent forward six light tanks without infantry support to sweep the area in front of the Marine lines ; four Japanese 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 46 in ) anti @-@ tank guns destroyed or disabled three of them . After abandoning their burning tanks , several of the disabled tanks ' <unk> were <unk> and killed by the Japanese . One tank <unk> down an embankment into the <unk> River , drowning its crew . 
 At 23 : 00 on 14 September , the remnants of the <unk> battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the Marine lines , but were repulsed . A final " weak " attack by the <unk> unit on the evening of 15 September was also defeated . 
 <unk> 's unit of about 650 men attacked the Marines at several locations on the west side of the <unk> perimeter . At about 04 : 00 on 14 September , two Japanese companies attacked positions held by the 3rd Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment ( 3 / 5 ) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses . Another Japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of 14 September . The rest of <unk> 's unit failed to find the Marine lines and did not participate in the attack . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 At 13 : 05 on 14 September , <unk> led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle , where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day . <unk> 's units were then ordered to withdraw west to the <unk> River valley to join with <unk> 's unit , a 6 mi ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) march over difficult terrain . <unk> 's troops began the march on the morning of 16 September . Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded . As the march progressed , the exhausted and hungry soldiers , who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal , began to <unk> their heavy equipment and then their rifles . By the time most of them reached <unk> 's positions at <unk> five days later , only half still carried their weapons . The <unk> battalion 's survivors , attempting to follow <unk> 's Center Body forces , became lost , wandered for three weeks in the jungle , and almost <unk> to death before finally reaching <unk> 's camp . 
 In total , <unk> 's forces lost about 830 killed in the attack , including 350 in Tamura 's battalion , 200 in <unk> 's battalion , 120 in <unk> 's force , 100 in the <unk> battalion , and 60 in <unk> 's battalion . An unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the <unk> . On and around the ridge , the Marines counted 500 Japanese dead , including 200 on the slopes of Hill 123 . The Marines suffered 80 killed between 12 and 14 September . 
 On 17 September , <unk> sent two companies from the 1st Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment ( 1 / 1 ) to pursue the retreating Japanese . The Marines were ambushed by two Japanese companies acting as rear @-@ guards for the withdrawal , and one Marine platoon was pinned down as the rest of the Marines retreated . The Marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by <unk> . By nightfall , the Japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon , killing 24 Marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving . On 20 September , a patrol from <unk> 's Raiders encountered stragglers from <unk> 's retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed 19 of them . 
 As the Japanese regrouped west of the <unk> , the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their <unk> defenses . On 14 September , <unk> moved another battalion , the 3rd Battalion , 2nd Marine Regiment ( 3 / 2 ) , from <unk> to <unk> . On 18 September , an Allied naval convoy delivered 4 @,@ 157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade ( the U.S. 7th Marine Regiment augmented by additional support units ) to <unk> . These reinforcements allowed <unk> — beginning on 19 September — to establish an unbroken line of defense around the <unk> perimeter . <unk> 's forces ' next significant clashes with the Japanese occurred along the <unk> River from 23 – 27 September and 6 – 9 October .

 On 15 September , General <unk> at Rabaul learned of <unk> 's defeat , the Imperial Japanese Army 's first defeat involving a unit of this size in the war . The general <unk> the news to the Imperial General Headquarters in Japan . In an emergency session , the top Japanese army and navy command staffs concluded that , " <unk> might develop into the decisive battle of the war . " The results of the battle began to have a telling strategic impact on Japanese operations in other areas of the Pacific . <unk> realized that , in order to send sufficient troops and materiel to defeat the Allied forces on <unk> , he could no longer support the major Japanese offensive on the <unk> Track in New Guinea . <unk> — with the <unk> of the General Headquarters — ordered his troops on New Guinea , who were within 30 mi ( 48 km ) of their objective of Port Moresby — to withdraw until the <unk> matter was resolved . The Japanese were never able to restart their drive towards Port Moresby ; the defeat at <unk> 's Ridge contributed not only to Japan 's defeat in the <unk> campaign , but also to Japan 's ultimate defeat throughout the South Pacific . 
 After delivering more forces during the next month the Japanese mounted a major ground offensive on <unk> , led by <unk> , in late October 1942 at the Battle for Henderson Field , but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the Japanese . <unk> later stated that <unk> 's assault on the ridge in September was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded , " we would have been in a pretty bad condition . " Historian Richard B. Frank adds , " The Japanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in September 1942 , on a ridge <unk> up from the jungle just south of the critical airfield , best known ever after as Bloody Ridge .

 Route 50 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey . It runs 26 @.@ 02 mi ( 41 @.@ 88 km ) from an intersection with U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) and the Garden State Parkway in Upper Township , Cape May County to an intersection with US 30 and County Route <unk> ( CR <unk> ) in <unk> Harbor City , Atlantic County . The route , which is mostly a two @-@ lane undivided road , passes through mostly rural areas of Atlantic and Cape May counties as well as the communities of <unk> , <unk> City , <unk> Manor , and Mays Landing . <unk> 50 intersects several roads , including Route 49 in <unk> , US 40 in Mays Landing , and US 322 and the Atlantic City Expressway in Hamilton Township . 
 The portion of current Route 50 between <unk> and Petersburg received funding in 1910 to become a spur of the Ocean Highway . In 1917 , what is now Route 50 was designated a part of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 , a route that was to run from Cape May to <unk> Harbor City . Route 50 was designated onto its current alignment in 1927 , replacing this portion of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 . In 1960 , a freeway was proposed for Route 50 , running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township to US 30 in <unk> Township . This proposal was canceled by the mid @-@ 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic . The interchange between Route 50 and the Atlantic City Expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange , with completion in June 2010 .

 Route 50 begins at an intersection with US 9 in the <unk> section of Upper Township , Cape May County , heading to the north on a two @-@ lane undivided road . From the southern terminus , a ramp provides access to and from the southbound Garden State Parkway . The road heads north through mostly rural wooded areas with some buildings . It intersects CR <unk> in <unk> before coming to a junction with CR <unk> . Later , Route 50 Cedar Swamp Creek in an area of <unk> . At this crossing , the road runs closely parallel to a <unk> <unk> <unk> Operations railroad line before entering Petersburg , where it splits from the railroad tracks and comes to a <unk> with CR 610 . Upon leaving Petersburg , Route 50 turns to the north again and crosses over the <unk> <unk> <unk> Operations railroad line , intersecting CR <unk> . It continues to <unk> and comes to CR <unk> . Past this intersection , the route meets CR <unk> and CR <unk> . Route 50 forms a concurrency with CR <unk> and the two routes head north and encounter the eastern terminus of Route 49 before leaving <unk> . 
 Not far after Route 49 , the road crosses the <unk> River into <unk> City , Atlantic County . In <unk> City , it heads into residential areas , with CR <unk> <unk> to the west of the route . Route 50 and CR <unk> continue northwest and intersect CR 648 , where the road turns north into more forested areas . At the junction with CR 645 , the route turns to the northeast and enters <unk> Manor , becoming Broad Street . CR <unk> splits from Route 50 by heading northwest on Buena <unk> Road and Route 50 heads through some agricultural <unk> concurrent with CR <unk> Truck , passing to the west of the <unk> Wildlife Area , which is known as a breeding ground for several species of birds . The route intersects CR <unk> , turning to the northeast . 
 After passing some homes and Stephen Lake , the road turns to the north and passes to the west of <unk> Manor County Park . The route crosses the South River into <unk> Township , passing the residential community of <unk> to the east and meeting CR <unk> . It soon enters Hamilton Township , where the name of the road becomes Mill Street and it comes to a junction with US 40 ( Harding Highway ) . CR <unk> Truck heads to the west on US 40 at this point while Route 50 heads east on US 40 , and CR <unk> continues north . 
 US 40 and <unk> 50 follow the Harding Highway , a two @-@ lane undivided road , turning to the northeast and crossing the Great <unk> Harbor River . Upon passing over the river , enters Mays Landing and turns north , encountering CR <unk> before passing over an abandoned railroad line and heading into the downtown area of Mays Landing . Here , the road crosses CR <unk> , and US 40 splits from <unk> 50 by turning east along that road . Meanwhile , Route 50 continues north on Cape May Avenue , passing through developed areas . It leaves Mays Landing and heads into back into forests . The route turns to the northeast , passing near the <unk> Leaf Lakes residential development , before coming to an interchange with US 322 ( Black Horse Pike ) . 
 Past this interchange , Route 50 <unk> to a four @-@ lane divided highway and reaches a full interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway . The route becomes a two @-@ lane undivided road again and continues through inhabited areas , crossing into Galloway Township , where there is an intersection with CR <unk> . A short distance later , the road crosses New Jersey Transit ’ s Atlantic City Line near the <unk> Harbor City Station and enters <unk> Harbor City , turning into Philadelphia Avenue . A block after the railroad crossing , Route 50 ends at an intersection with US 30 and CR <unk> ( White Horse Pike ) , with CR <unk> continuing north on Philadelphia Avenue at this point . 
 Route 50 is an important route linking the Atlantic City Expressway with the Jersey Shore resorts in Cape May County , serving as an alternate to more <unk> routes . It also serves as evacuation route from Cape May County to inland areas in the event of a hurricane .

 = Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> = 
 
 Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army ( <unk> ) on 3 September 1978 , during the Rhodesian Bush War . The aircraft involved , a Vickers Viscount named the <unk> , was flying the last leg of Air Rhodesia 's regular scheduled service from Victoria Falls to the capital Salisbury , via the resort town of <unk> . 
 Soon after Flight <unk> took off , a group of <unk> guerrillas scored a direct hit on its starboard wing with a Soviet @-@ made <unk> 2 surface @-@ to @-@ air infrared <unk> missile , critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing . An attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of <unk> was <unk> by an unseen ditch , which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up . Of the 52 passengers and four crew , 38 died in this crash ; the insurgents then approached the wreckage , rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire . Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush , while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived . 
 <unk> leader Joshua <unk> publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the <unk> in an interview with the BBC 's Today programme the same evening , saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes , but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground . The majority of <unk> , both black and white , saw the attack as an act of terrorism . A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies , with many whites becoming <unk> <unk> and suspicious of blacks in general , even though few black <unk> supported attacks of this kind . Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine , but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments , much to the Rhodesian government 's <unk> . 
 <unk> between <unk> and Prime Minister Ian Smith , which had been progressing <unk> , were immediately suspended by the furious <unk> , with Smith calling <unk> a " monster " . On 10 September , Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas . The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months , attacking both <unk> and its rival , the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA ) . The attack on <unk> in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions . Five months later , in February 1979 , <unk> shot down Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> , another civilian flight , in an almost identical incident . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self @-@ governing colony of Rhodesia ( or Southern Rhodesia ) led the colonial government , headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith , to <unk> declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965 . The idea of " no independence before majority rule " had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation , and Rhodesia 's government was dominated by the country 's white minority , so the unilateral declaration went <unk> internationally . Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia . 
 Two rival communist @-@ backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule : the Chinese @-@ aligned Zimbabwe African National Union ( <unk> ) , mostly comprising <unk> , created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA ) and adopted aspects of <unk> doctrine , while the <unk> @-@ dominated Zimbabwe African People 's Union ( <unk> ) , aligned with Soviet @-@ style <unk> – <unk> and the Warsaw Pact , mobilised the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army ( <unk> ) . These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the " Second <unk> " against the Rhodesian government and security forces . The resulting conflict , the Rhodesian Bush War , began in earnest in December 1972 , when ZANLA attacked <unk> and <unk> <unk> in north @-@ eastern Rhodesia . 
 After the security forces mounted a successful counter @-@ insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974 , developments overseas caused the conflict 's momentum to shift in the insurgents ' favour . The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith 's administration , and led to Mozambique 's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with <unk> . Around the same time , Rhodesia 's other main <unk> , South Africa , adopted a <unk> initiative that forced a ceasefire , giving the guerrillas time to regroup . Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975 , Smith and the <unk> leader Joshua <unk> held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976 . <unk> and <unk> announced in October 1976 , during the run @-@ up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December , that they would <unk> attend conferences as a joint " Patriotic Front " . 
 In March 1978 , Smith and non @-@ militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop <unk> <unk> , the Reverend <unk> <unk> and Chief Jeremiah <unk> agreed what became the " Internal Settlement " . This created a joint black – white transitional government , with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in June 1979 , pursuant to <unk> elections . <unk> and <unk> were invited to participate , but refused ; <unk> <unk> dubbed Smith 's black colleagues " the blacksmiths " . <unk> proclaimed 1978 to be " The Year of the People " as the war continued . Officials from <unk> 's United African National Council , sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks , were killed by Marxist – <unk> guerrillas . <unk> also began to target Christian missionaries , <unk> in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at <unk> Mission near the Mozambican border on 23 June . 
 The transitional government was badly received abroad , partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement , the military , the judiciary and the civil service under white control . No country recognised Rhodesia 's interim administration . Smith again worked to bring <unk> into the government , hoping this would lend it some <unk> domestically , prompt diplomatic recognition overseas , and help the security forces defeat ZANLA . Starting on 14 August 1978 , he attended secret meetings with <unk> in <unk> , Zambia ( where <unk> was based ) , doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation <unk> . Attempts were made to also involve the <unk> leader Robert <unk> , but <unk> would have no part in the talks . According to the South African military historian <unk> <unk> , negotiations between Smith and <unk> progressed well and " seemed on the verge of success " by the start of September 1978 . On 2 September , Smith and <unk> revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place .

 Rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about 1977 , in the latter stages of the war ; before this time , neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target . The weapon that made such attacks feasible for <unk> was the <unk> 2 shoulder @-@ launched surface @-@ to @-@ air missile launcher , supplied by the Soviet Union from the mid @-@ 1970s as part of the Warsaw Pact 's materiel support . By September 1978 , there had been 20 reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons , none of which had been successful . Some Rhodesian Air Force Dakotas had been hit , but all had survived and landed safely . No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War .

 The Flight <unk> aircraft was a Vickers Viscount <unk> , a British @-@ made turboprop aircraft with two engines on each wing . It was named the <unk> after the river of the same name , which flowed between Lake <unk> and the Rhodesian capital Salisbury . 
 The <unk> was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between Victoria Falls and Salisbury , stopping over in the resort town of <unk> . Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on <unk> by <unk> guerrillas on the northern side of the <unk> ( in Zambia ) , the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia 's choice tourist destinations . The flight on 3 September 1978 , Sunday afternoon , from <unk> to Salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers , most of whom were <unk> from Salisbury , returning home after a weekend at the lake . The flight took off from <unk> Airport on schedule soon after 17 : 00 Central Africa Time . 
 Flight <unk> was <unk> by 36 @-@ year @-@ old Captain John Hood , a native of <unk> who had gained his commercial pilot licence in 1966 . He had flown <unk> for Air Rhodesia since 1968 , and had also served in the Rhodesian Air Force on a voluntary basis . His first officer , Garth Beaumont , was 31 years old , and had lived in Rhodesia for most of his life , having immigrated as a child from South Africa . The two air <unk> were <unk> <unk> , 21 years old and from <unk> , and 23 @-@ year @-@ old Louise Pearson , from Salisbury .

 A group of <unk> guerrillas , armed with a <unk> @-@ 2 launcher , waited in the bush beneath Flight <unk> 's <unk> , and fired on the <unk> about five minutes after it took off , while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight . The heat @-@ seeking missile hit the plane 's starboard wing and exploded , causing the inner engine to also explode . A fuel tank and hydraulic lines <unk> , creating a fire that the passengers and crew could not put out . The second starboard engine failed almost immediately , leaving Hood with only his two port engines . <unk> wildly , the <unk> began to descend rapidly . 
 At 17 : 10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control , informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash . " We 're going in , " he <unk> . <unk> his passengers to <unk> for an emergency landing , he aimed for an open field of cotton in the <unk> Hills , in the bush to the west of <unk> , intending to belly land the craft . The landing was relatively stable until the <unk> hit a previously unseen ditch , <unk> and exploded . The remaining fuel tanks <unk> and caught fire , setting the wrecked cabin <unk> .

 Of the 56 people on board , 38 , including Hood and Beaumont , died in the crash . Eighteen survived , albeit with injuries , and climbed out of the wreckage . After briefly settling the others , one of the passengers , Dr Cecil <unk> , led four others — young <unk> Robert and Shannon <unk> , Mrs Sharon <unk> , and her four @-@ year @-@ old daughter Tracey — off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water . The other 13 remained close to the wreckage . Meanwhile , nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site , and reached it at about 17 : 45 . Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching : Rhodesian Army <unk> Anthony Hill , 39 , took cover in the surrounding bush , while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same . This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage , including four women and two girls ( aged 11 and 4 ) . 
 The guerrillas , who were armed with AK @-@ 47 rifles , presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly , saying they would summon help and bring water . They spoke in English , both to the survivors and among themselves . They told the passengers to <unk> around a point a few metres from the wreckage ; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk , the insurgents told the able @-@ bodied men to carry the others . The passengers were assembled into an area of about 10 square metres ( 110 sq ft ) . Standing roughly 15 metres ( 49 ft ) away , the cadres now raised their weapons . " You have taken our land , " one of them said . " Please don 't shoot us ! " one of the passengers cried , just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire . 
 Having collected water from the nearby village , <unk> and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots . <unk> it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat , they continued on their way , and called out to the other passengers , who they thought were still alive . This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors ; one of the guerrillas told <unk> 's group to " come here " . The insurgents then opened fire on their general location , prompting <unk> and the others to flee . Hill and the <unk> also ran ; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their <unk> , but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge . After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours , they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19 : 45 . The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the <unk> <unk> around the site , filled their arms with various passengers ' belongings , then left again . 
 The survivors were found over the following days by the Rhodesian Army and police ; Hill and Mr and Mrs Hansen were taken to <unk> Hospital , while <unk> and his group were <unk> to Andrew Fleming Hospital in Salisbury .

 <unk> claimed responsibility for the attack in an interview with the BBC 's Today radio programme the next day , laughing as he did so , to the horror of most Rhodesian observers , both black and white . He said that he had received intelligence that the <unk> was being used for military purposes . <unk> said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party 's policy to kill civilians , and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground ; by contrast , he said that his men had helped them , and had left them alive . He also accused Air Rhodesia of <unk> <unk> troops and war materiel for the government , an allegation that Captain Pat Travers , Air Rhodesia 's general manager , called a " downright , deliberate lie " . 
 According to <unk> <unk> , a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of <unk> , <unk> was implying that responsibility for the massacre actually lay with security force pseudo @-@ guerrillas , more specifically the mixed race <unk> Scouts unit , which had often been accused of <unk> rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion . <unk> asserts that the massacre " cannot be put beyond " the Scouts , and also supports <unk> 's claim that the <unk> had been used militarily , suggesting that <unk> might have believed there to be Rhodesian soldiers on board . " Rhodesian television , before attacks on ZANLA in Mozambique , had shown <unk> ferrying paratroopers for the job , " he writes , " ... [ and ] <unk> intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed [ at Victoria Falls ] " .

 A report published in the American magazine Time a fortnight later described the incident as " a genuine horror story , calculated to make the most <unk> of Rhodesian <unk> <unk> seem true . " Indeed , the white community in Rhodesia heard the news with <unk> , and many turned their minds to exacting <unk> for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism . The prominent Indian @-@ Rhodesian <unk> family was particularly affected by the incident , having lost eight members in the attack . Though Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash , doing so only after four days ' investigation , the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours . Smith wrote in his memoirs that the " degree of anger ... [ was ] difficult to control " . White South Africans were similarly enraged , particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the <unk> had raped the female passengers before <unk> them . A Friends of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of <unk> to anybody who would either kill <unk> or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial . 
 Geoffrey <unk> , who was then one of the few black reporters at the Rhodesia Herald newspaper , later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became <unk> and wary towards blacks in general , believing them all to be " terrorist <unk> " . Describing the Herald <unk> the night of the incident , he relates a " <unk> collective temper " among the white sub @-@ editors : " They cursed until their voices became <unk> , threatening dire consequences for all <unk> and <unk> or <unk> ... I <unk> that some of the more derogatory remarks made in <unk> loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears . " 
 Several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days . According to the Time article , a group of whites entered an <unk> Salisbury bar " fingering the <unk> of rifles " and forced blacks drinking there to leave . Time also reported a <unk> that two white youths , on learning of the massacre , shot the first black man they saw . Smith says that several would @-@ be <unk> groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to " make the local people pay for their crime of <unk> and assisting the terrorists " . He instructed them not to , according to his memoirs , telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme <unk> , and that it would not do to attack them . Many <unk> also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments , especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target .

 At a memorial service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight <unk> 's passengers and crew at Salisbury 's Anglican Cathedral , about 2 @,@ 000 people crowded inside , with another 500 standing outside on the steps and pavement , many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets . <unk> among those present in the cathedral were <unk> Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel , as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units . Smith and several government ministers also attended , including P K van der <unk> , the co @-@ Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
 Dean John de Costa gave a sermon <unk> what he described as a " <unk> silence " from overseas . " Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but <unk> at the events attending the Viscount , " he said . " But are we <unk> with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves <unk> ? We are not ! Like men in the story of the Good <unk> , they pass by on the other side ...

 The talks between Smith and the <unk> leader that had been progressing so <unk> were immediately halted by Salisbury .

He <unk> that an agreement between the two " at this critical stage " might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition . 
 On 10 September , the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of martial law , which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed . He declared Rhodesia 's intent to " <unk> the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism " , and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for " any defensive strikes we might undertake " against guerrilla bases in their respective territories . He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front .

 Because <unk> and <unk> were based in Zambia , many <unk> <unk> for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country , but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount <unk> was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around <unk> in Mozambique . The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during Operation <unk> , destroying much of the ZANLA presence there , but the insurgents had since built a complex called " New <unk> " , slightly to the east ; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals . In a combined airborne @-@ ground assault called Operation <unk> , the Rhodesian Air Force , Rhodesian Light Infantry and Special Air Service wiped out much of New <unk> on 20 September 1978 . Mozambique sent armour to ZANLA 's aid in the form of nine Soviet @-@ made T @-@ 54 tanks and four Russian <unk> @-@ 152 armoured personnel carriers , but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces . According to Rhodesian figures , there were " several hundred " guerrillas killed , while the security forces lost only two soldiers , one of whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike .

 Rhodesia then attacked <unk> 's bases in Zambia , in what Group Captain Peter <unk> @-@ Bowyer later described as " <unk> time " for Flight <unk> . Operation <unk> , launched on 19 October 1978 , was another joint @-@ force operation between the Air Force and the Army , which contributed Special Air Service and Rhodesian Light Infantry paratroopers . <unk> 's primary target , just 16 kilometres ( 10 miles ) north @-@ east of central <unk> , was the formerly white @-@ owned <unk> Farm , which had been transformed into <unk> 's main headquarters and training base under the name " Freedom Camp " . <unk> presumed that Rhodesia would never <unk> to attack a site so close to <unk> . About 4 @,@ 000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp , with senior <unk> staff also on site . The Rhodesian operation 's other targets were <unk> , 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north of <unk> , and <unk> Camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia . <unk> targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked . 
 <unk> by Squadron Leader Chris Dixon , who identified himself to <unk> Airport tower as " Green Leader " , a Rhodesian Air Force group flew into Zambia at very low altitudes ( thereby avoiding <unk> radar ) and took control of the country 's airspace for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on <unk> Farm , informing <unk> tower that the attack was against " Rhodesian dissidents , and not against Zambia " , and that Rhodesian Hawker Hunters were <unk> the <unk> airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off . The <unk> <unk> all of Green Leader 's instructions , made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic . Using <unk> airstrip in eastern Zambia as a forward base , the Rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the three @-@ day operation , and afterwards claimed to have killed over 1 @,@ 500 <unk> personnel , as well as some Cuban instructors . 
 Historians Paul <unk> and Peter <unk> write that this exaggerated considerably the actual number of guerrillas killed , as most of <unk> 's army , then numbering about 10 @,@ 000 fighters , had not been touched . On the other hand , unarmed refugees often camped in or around insurgent positions , and hundreds of these had been killed in the Rhodesian raid . <unk> and <unk> comment that for the Rhodesian airmen , it would have been " impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young <unk> recruits . " <unk> describes Freedom Camp as " a refugee camp for boys " , and says " <unk> boys and girls " were killed . He claims that the Red Cross and the UN <unk> Agency " confirmed <unk> 's claim that Smith 's forces struck at <unk> , civilian <unk> " . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 The Rhodesian attacks on ZANLA and <unk> bases did much to restore white morale following the Viscount incident , though they had not actually made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns . <unk> and the <unk> President Kenneth <unk> all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the Soviets and the British respectively . Martial law was quickly extended across Rhodesia 's rural areas , and covered three @-@ quarters of the country by the end of 1978 . Air Rhodesia , meanwhile , began developing anti @-@ <unk> shielding for its <unk> . Before this work was completed , <unk> shot down a second Viscount , Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> , on 12 February 1979 . This time there were no survivors . 
 Following the second <unk> , Air Rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the <unk> would be coated with low @-@ radiation paint , with the exhaust pipes concurrently <unk> . According to tests conducted by the Air Force , a Viscount so treated could not be detected by the <unk> 's targeting system once it was over 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) . There were no further Viscount <unk> in Rhodesia . 
 In the elections held the following year under the Internal Settlement terms , boycotted by <unk> and <unk> , <unk> won a majority , and became the first Prime Minister of the reconstituted , majority @-@ ruled state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 1 June 1979 . This new order failed to win international acceptance , however , and in December 1979 the Lancaster House Agreement was agreed in London by Zimbabwe Rhodesia , the UK government and the Patriotic Front , returning the country to its former colonial status . The UK government suspended the constitution and took direct control for an interim period . Fresh elections were won by <unk> , who took power in April 1980 , concurrently with the country 's recognised independence as Zimbabwe .

 In modern Zimbabwe , it is not the Viscount <unk> but rather the <unk> Rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory . State media in Zimbabwe , prominently the Herald newspaper , often claim that Rhodesian forces <unk> and deliberately <unk> thousands of helpless refugees during such operations . <unk> 's <unk> of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board . The massacre of surviving Flight <unk> passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than <unk> ; in his 1984 memoirs <unk> repeated his claim that <unk> fighters had helped the survivors , and wrote simply that " I truly have no idea how the ten died " . 
 A monument to those killed in the Rhodesian attack on <unk> was built in Zambia in 1998 , and dedicated jointly by the <unk> and <unk> governments . A memorial to the victims of the two Rhodesian Viscount incidents , dubbed the Viscount Memorial , was erected on the grounds of the <unk> Monument in <unk> , South Africa in 2012 , and inaugurated on 1 September that year . The names of the dead passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stand upright , side by side , the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft . A pole beside the monument flies the Rhodesian flag . 
 A British parliamentary motion put forward by Labour MP Kate <unk> in February 2013 to <unk> <unk> the Viscount attacks and <unk> the victims on the anniversary of the second <unk> prompted <unk> in the <unk> press , with the Herald branding it a racist " <unk> motion " intended to <unk> the <unk> administration and its supporters . <unk> <unk> , a former <unk> commander , described the move as a <unk> motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at Lancaster House . Christopher <unk> , a diplomat and political analyst , took a similar line , calling <unk> 's proposed commemoration " a <unk> ... [ that ] means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle . There is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside the country . " <unk> 's official response to <unk> 's motion included the assertion that in all conflicts " civilians get caught up in cross @-@ fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors " , and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the Viscount <unk> with those killed at <unk> .

 <unk> ( / <unk> / ) ( <unk> ’ al in modern <unk> <unk> ) is the ruins of an ancient city found in a <unk> in Guatemala . <unk> <unk> , a gum @-@ <unk> , reported the ruins to La <unk> , a <unk> newspaper , which named the site <unk> . After the Berlin Academy of Sciences ' magazine republished the report in 1853 , <unk> and treasure hunters began visiting the forest . Today tourism to the site may help protect the <unk> . It is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre @-@ Columbian Maya civilization . It is located in the archaeological region of the <unk> Basin in what is now northern Guatemala . Situated in the department of El <unk> , the site is part of Guatemala 's <unk> National Park and in 1979 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 <unk> was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient Maya . Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century BC , <unk> reached its <unk> during the Classic Period , c . 200 to 900 AD . During this time , the city dominated much of the Maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout <unk> such as the great metropolis of <unk> in the distant Valley of Mexico . There is evidence that <unk> was conquered by <unk> in the 4th century AD . Following the end of the Late Classic Period , no new major monuments were built at <unk> and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned . These events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site ’ s abandonment by the end of the 10th century . 
 <unk> is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities , with a long dynastic ruler list , the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments , temples and palaces . 
 
 = = Etymology = = 
 
 The name <unk> may be derived from <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> Maya language ; it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning " at the <unk> " . The name was apparently applied to one of the site 's ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region . It has alternatively been interpreted as meaning " the place of the voices " in the <unk> Maya language . <unk> , however , is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the 1840s . <unk> inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , meaning " First <unk> " . <unk> may have come to have been called this because <unk> <unk> also came to use the same emblem glyph ; the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name . The kingdom as a whole was simply called <unk> , which is the reading of the " hair bundle " emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo . Its precise meaning remains obscure . 
 
 = = Location = = 
 
 The closest large modern settlements are Flores and Santa <unk> , approximately 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) by road to the southwest . <unk> is approximately <unk> kilometres ( 188 mi ) north of Guatemala City . It is 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) south of the contemporary Maya city of <unk> and 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) northwest of <unk> . The city was located 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) southeast of its great Classic Period rival , <unk> , and 85 kilometres ( 53 mi ) northwest of <unk> 's ally <unk> , now in Belize . 
 The city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than 16 square kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) that included about 3 @,@ 000 structures . The topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands . The major architecture of the site is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised <unk> spanning the swamps . The area around <unk> has been declared as the <unk> National Park and the preserved area covers 570 square kilometres ( 220 sq mi ) . 
 The ruins lie among the tropical rainforests of northern Guatemala that formed the <unk> of lowland Maya civilization . The city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils , and may have dominated a natural east – west trade route across the <unk> Peninsula . <unk> trees at the <unk> park include gigantic <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) the sacred tree of the Maya ; tropical cedar ( <unk> <unk> ) , and Honduras mahogany ( <unk> <unk> ) . Regarding the fauna , <unk> , white @-@ <unk> <unk> , gray foxes , <unk> 's spider monkeys , <unk> monkeys , <unk> eagles , falcons , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , green parrots and <unk> ants can be seen there regularly . <unk> , <unk> , and cougars are also said to <unk> in the park . For centuries this city was completely covered under jungle . The average annual rainfall at <unk> is 1 @,@ <unk> millimetres ( 76 @.@ 6 in ) . 
 One of the largest of the Classic Maya cities , <unk> had no water other than what was collected from <unk> and stored in ten reservoirs . Archaeologists working in <unk> during the 20th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use . 
 The <unk> National Park covers an area of 575 @.@ 83 square kilometres ( 222 @.@ 33 sq mi ) . It was created on 26 May 1955 under the auspices of the <unk> de <unk> e Historia and was the first protected area in Guatemala . 
 
 = = Population = = 
 
 Population estimates for <unk> vary from 10 @,@ 000 to as high as 90 @,@ 000 inhabitants , with the most likely figure being at the upper end of this range . 
 The population of <unk> began a continuous curve of growth starting in the <unk> Period ( approximately 2000 BC – AD 200 ) , with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD 700 through to 830 , followed by a sharp decline . For the 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) area falling within the <unk> defenses of the hinterland , the peak population is estimated at <unk> per square kilometer ( <unk> per square mile ) . In an area within a 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) radius of the site core , peak population is estimated at 120 @,@ 000 ; population density is estimated at 265 per square kilometer ( <unk> per square mile ) . In a region within a 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) radius of the site core and including some satellite sites , peak population is estimated at 425 @,@ 000 with a density of 216 per square kilometer ( 515 per square mile ) . These population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive <unk> that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture . However , some archaeologists , such as David Webster , believe these figures to be far too high .

 There are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as 1000 BC , in the Middle <unk> . A <unk> of <unk> ceramics dating from about 700 @-@ 400 BC were found in a sealed <unk> , a subterranean bottle @-@ shaped chamber . 
 Major construction at <unk> was already taking place in the Late <unk> period , first appearing around 400 – 300 BC , including the building of major pyramids and platforms , although the city was still <unk> by sites further north such as El <unk> and <unk> . At this time , <unk> participated in the widespread <unk> culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time – a region that included the entire <unk> Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize . 
 Two temples dating to Late <unk> times had masonry @-@ walled <unk> that may have been <unk> @-@ vaulted , although this has not been proven . One of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a <unk> background , painted in yellow , black , pink and red . 
 In the 1st century AD rich burials first appeared and <unk> underwent a political and cultural <unk> as its giant northern neighbors declined . At the end of the Late <unk> , the <unk> style art and architecture from the Pacific Coast began to influence <unk> , as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the <unk> and early murals at the city .

 <unk> rulership among the lowland Maya is most deeply rooted at <unk> . According to later hieroglyphic records , the dynasty was founded by <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> , perhaps in the 3rd century AD . At the beginning of the Early Classic , power in the Maya region was concentrated at <unk> and <unk> , in the core of the Maya <unk> . 
 <unk> may have benefited from the collapse of the large <unk> states such as El <unk> . In the Early Classic <unk> rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the Maya region , <unk> the development of other nearby Maya cities . 
 The site , however , was often at war and inscriptions tell of <unk> and conflict with other Maya states , including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The site was defeated at the end of the Early Classic by <unk> , which rose to take <unk> 's place as the paramount center in the southern Maya lowlands . The earlier part of the Early Classic saw hostilities between <unk> and its neighbor <unk> , with <unk> recording the capture of prisoners from <unk> . 
 There appears to have been a breakdown in the male succession by AD 317 , when Lady <unk> <unk> conducted a <unk> @-@ ending ceremony , apparently as queen of the city .

 The fourteenth king of <unk> was <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak ( Great Jaguar <unk> ) . <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the Central Acropolis . Little is known about <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak except that he was killed on 14 January <unk> AD . On the same day , <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ ( Fire Is Born ) arrived from the west , having passed through El Peru , a site to the west of <unk> , on 8 January . On Stela 31 he is named as " Lord of the West " . <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non @-@ Maya <unk> of a <unk> combined with an owl , a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of <unk> in the distant Valley of Mexico . <unk> Owl may even have been the ruler of <unk> . These recorded events strongly suggest that <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ led a <unk> invasion that defeated the native <unk> king , who was captured and immediately executed . <unk> K <unk> ' appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at <unk> itself ; roughly at the time of the conquest , a group of <unk> natives were apparently residing near the Lost World complex . He also exerted control over other cities in the area , including <unk> , where he became king , but did not take the throne of <unk> for himself . Within a year , the son of <unk> Owl by the name of <unk> <unk> <unk> I ( First Crocodile ) had been installed as the tenth king of <unk> while he was still a boy , being enthroned on 13 September <unk> . He reigned for 47 years as king of <unk> , and remained a vassal of <unk> K <unk> ' for as long as the latter lived . It seems likely that <unk> <unk> <unk> I took a wife from the <unk> , defeated , <unk> dynasty and thus <unk> the right to rule of his son , <unk> Chan K 'awiil II . 
 <unk> <unk> , a small site 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) northeast of <unk> , was conquered by the latter during the reign of <unk> <unk> <unk> I. The site became an outpost of <unk> , shielding it from hostile cities further north , and also became a trade link to the Caribbean . 
 Although the new rulers of <unk> were foreign , their descendants were rapidly <unk> . <unk> became the key ally and trading partner of <unk> in the Maya lowlands . After being conquered by <unk> , <unk> rapidly dominated the northern and eastern <unk> . <unk> , together with smaller towns in the region , were absorbed into <unk> 's kingdom . Other sites , such as <unk> and <unk> de San José near Lake <unk> <unk> became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north . By the middle of the 5th century <unk> had a core territory of at least 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) in every direction . 
 Around the 5th century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of <unk> 's hinterland , joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of <unk> lying to the east and west of the city . Additional fortifications were probably also built to the south . These defenses protected <unk> 's core population and agricultural resources , <unk> an area of approximately 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) . Recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose .

 In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as <unk> , whose founder K 'inich <unk> K <unk> ' Mo ' was clearly connected with <unk> . <unk> itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the <unk> dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of <unk> . K 'inich <unk> K <unk> ' Mo ' arrived in <unk> in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at <unk> . An individual known as <unk> K <unk> ' Mo ' ( lord K <unk> ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at <unk> and may well be the same person . His tomb had <unk> characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior <unk> of <unk> . <unk> texts refer to him as " Lord of the West " , much like <unk> K ’ <unk> ’ . At the same time , in late 426 , <unk> founded the nearby site of <unk> , possibly sponsored by <unk> itself . The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose <unk> 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region . The interaction between these sites and <unk> was intense over the next three centuries . 
 A long @-@ running rivalry between <unk> and <unk> began in the 6th century , with each of the two cities forming its own network of mutually hostile <unk> <unk> against each other in what has been likened to a long @-@ running war between two Maya <unk> . The kings of these two capitals adopted the title <unk> ' , a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to " high king " . 
 The early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city , known only as the " Lady of <unk> " , who was very likely a daughter of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak II . She seems never to have ruled in her own right , rather being partnered with male co @-@ rulers . The first of these was <unk> ' B <unk> , who seems to have had a long career as a general at <unk> before becoming co @-@ ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence . The Lady of <unk> herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering . It appears she was later paired with lord " Bird Claw " , who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler . .

 In the mid 6th century , <unk> seems to have allied with <unk> and defeated <unk> , closing the Early Classic . The " <unk> hiatus " refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large @-@ scale construction at <unk> . In the latter half of the 6th century AD , a serious crisis <unk> the city , with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture . This hiatus in activity at <unk> was long unexplained until later <unk> <unk> identified that the period was prompted by <unk> 's comprehensive defeat at the hands of <unk> and the <unk> polity in AD 562 , a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of <unk> . The badly eroded Altar 21 at <unk> described how <unk> suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in April 562 . It seems that <unk> was an ally of <unk> in the wider conflict between that city and <unk> , with the defeat of <unk> having a lasting impact upon the city . <unk> was not sacked but its power and influence were broken . After its great victory , <unk> grew rapidly and some of <unk> 's population may have been forcibly relocated there . During the hiatus period , at least one ruler of <unk> took refuge with <unk> ' <unk> of Palenque , another of <unk> 's victims . <unk> itself <unk> during <unk> 's long hiatus period . 
 The beginning of the <unk> hiatus has served as a marker by which archaeologists commonly <unk> the Classic period of <unk> chronology into the Early and Late Classic .

 In <unk> <unk> founded <unk> <unk> , some 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) to the southwest , as a military outpost in order to control trade along the course of the <unk> River . B <unk> Chan K 'awiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at the age of four , in 635 , and for many years served as a loyal vassal fighting for his brother , the king of <unk> . Roughly twenty years later <unk> <unk> was attacked by <unk> and was soundly defeated . B <unk> Chan K 'awiil was captured by the king of <unk> but , instead of being sacrificed , he was re @-@ instated on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy , and attacked <unk> in <unk> , forcing <unk> <unk> Chaak , the then king of <unk> , to temporarily abandon the city . The first two rulers of <unk> <unk> continued to use the <unk> emblem glyph of <unk> , and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne of <unk> itself . For some reason , B <unk> Chan K 'awiil was not installed as the new ruler of <unk> ; instead he stayed at <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> against <unk> <unk> in <unk> , driving B <unk> Chan K 'awiil into an exile that lasted five years . <unk> tried to encircle <unk> within an area dominated by its allies , such as El Peru , <unk> <unk> and <unk> . 
 In 682 , <unk> Chan K 'awiil I erected the first dated monument at <unk> in 120 years and claimed the title of <unk> ' , so ending the hiatus . He initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on <unk> when , in <unk> , he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered . After this , <unk> never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory . 
 
 = = = = <unk> after <unk> = = = = 
 
 By the 7th century , there was no active <unk> presence at any Maya site and the center of <unk> had been razed by 700 . Even after this , formal war attire illustrated on monuments was <unk> style . <unk> Chan K 'awiil I and his heir <unk> 'in Chan K 'awiil continued hostilities against <unk> and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around <unk> , extending as far as the territory around Lake <unk> <unk> . These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today . 
 In 738 , <unk> , a vassal of <unk> , <unk> 's key ally in the south , switched allegiance to <unk> , defeated <unk> and gained its own independence . It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of <unk> to bring about the collapse of <unk> 's southern allies . This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of <unk> . 
 In the 8th century , the rulers of <unk> collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis . By the late 8th century and early 9th century , activity at <unk> slowed . <unk> architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers . 
 
 = = = Terminal Classic = = = 
 
 By the 9th century , the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region , with populations <unk> and city after city falling into silence . Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused <unk> 's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself , accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and corresponding environmental decline . Construction continued at the beginning of the century , with the erection of Temple 3 , the last of the city 's major pyramids and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K <unk> in <unk> . The beginning of the 10th <unk> <unk> in 830 passed <unk> , and marks the beginning of a 60 @-@ year hiatus , probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city . During this hiatus , satellite sites traditionally under <unk> 's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the <unk> emblem glyph , with <unk> apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence . In <unk> , <unk> K 'awiil is mentioned on a stela at <unk> as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of <unk> but he is not recorded elsewhere and <unk> 's once great power was little more than a memory . The sites of <unk> and <unk> had by now inherited the once exclusive <unk> emblem glyph . 
 As <unk> and its hinterland reached peak population , the area suffered <unk> , erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels . <unk> and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost the majority of its population during the period from 830 to 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly . There is not much evidence from <unk> that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic , although an influx of refugees from the <unk> region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources . 
 In the latter half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much diminished city of <unk> , as evidenced by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by <unk> Chan K 'awiil II in <unk> . This was the last monument erected at <unk> before the city finally fell into silence . The former satellites of <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , did not last much longer , <unk> their final monuments in <unk> . By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of <unk> 's population had deserted the city , its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple <unk> dwellings were being erected in the city 's ceremonial <unk> . The squatters blocked some <unk> in the rooms they <unk> in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non @-@ <unk> items such as musical instruments . These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them . Some monuments were <unk> and some were moved to new locations . Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared , with the tombs of the North Acropolis being explored for <unk> and the easier to find tombs being looted . After 950 , <unk> was all but deserted , although a remnant population may have survived in <unk> <unk> interspersed among the ruins . Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the <unk> claimed the ruins for the next thousand years . Some of <unk> 's population may have migrated to the <unk> Lakes region , which remained heavily populated in spite of a <unk> in population levels in the first half of the 9th century . 
 The most likely cause of collapse at <unk> is <unk> and agrarian failure . The fall of <unk> was a blow to the heart of Classic Maya civilization , the city having been at the forefront of courtly life , art and architecture for over a thousand years , with an ancient ruling dynasty . However , new research regarding <unk> <unk> from the <unk> reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of <unk> .

 In <unk> , the Spanish <unk> Hernán Cortés passed within a few kilometres of the ruins of <unk> but did not mention them in his letters . After Spanish friar <unk> de <unk> became lost in the <unk> forests in early <unk> he described a ruin that may well have been <unk> . 
 As is often the case with huge ancient ruins , knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region . It seems that local people never <unk> about <unk> and they guided <unk> expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s . Some second- or third @-@ hand accounts of <unk> appeared in print starting in the 17th century , continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century ( Stephens and his illustrator Frederick <unk> heard rumors of a lost city , with white building tops towering above the jungle , during their 1839 @-@ 40 travels in the region ) . Because of the site 's <unk> from modern towns , however , no explorers visited <unk> until <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , respectively the commissioner and the governor of <unk> , visited it in 1848 . Artist <unk> <unk> accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853 . Several other expeditions came to further investigate , map , and photograph <unk> in the 19th century ( including Alfred P. <unk> in 1881 @-@ 82 ) and the early 20th century . <unk> archaeologists started to clear , map and record the ruins in the 1880s . 
 In 1951 , a small airstrip was built at the ruins , which previously could only be reached by several days ' travel through the jungle on foot or mule . In 1956 the <unk> project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area . From 1956 through 1970 , major archaeological excavations were carried out by the University of Pennsylvania <unk> Project . They mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures . Excavations directed by Edwin M. <unk> and later by William Coe of the university investigated the North Acropolis and the Central Plaza from 1957 to 1969 . The <unk> Project recorded over 200 monuments at the site . In 1979 , the <unk> government began a further archeological project at <unk> , which continued through to 1984 . 
 <unk> George Lucas used <unk> as a filming location for the first Star Wars film , Episode IV : A New Hope , released in 1977 . Temple I at <unk> was featured on the reverse of the 50 <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> is now a major tourist attraction surrounded by its own national park . A site museum has been built at <unk> ; it was completed in 1964 .

 <unk> has been partially restored by the University of Pennsylvania and the government of Guatemala . It was one of the largest of the Classic period Maya cities and was one of the largest cities in the Americas . The architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over 70 metres ( 230 ft ) high , large royal palaces , in addition to a number of smaller pyramids , palaces , residences , administrative buildings , platforms and inscribed stone monuments . There is even a building which seemed to have been a jail , originally with wooden bars across the windows and doors . There are also seven courts for playing the <unk> <unk> , including a set of 3 in the Seven Temples Plaza , a unique feature in <unk> . 
 The limestone used for construction was local and <unk> on @-@ site . The depressions formed by the extraction of stone for building were plastered to <unk> them and were used as reservoirs , together with some <unk> natural depressions . The main <unk> were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that <unk> rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs . 
 The residential area of <unk> covers an estimated 60 square kilometres ( 23 sq mi ) , much of which has not yet been cleared , mapped , or excavated . A huge set of earthworks discovered by Dennis E. <unk> and Donald <unk> in the 1960s rings <unk> with a 6 @-@ metre ( 20 ft ) wide trench behind a rampart . The 16 square kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) area around the site core has been intensively mapped ; it may have enclosed an area of some 125 square kilometres ( 48 sq mi ) ( see below ) . Population estimates place the demographic size of the site between 10 @,@ 000 and 90 @,@ 000 , and possibly 425 @,@ 000 in the surrounding area . Recently , a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthworks is highly variable and that in many places it is <unk> as a defensive feature . In addition , some parts of the <unk> were integrated into a canal system . The <unk> of <unk> varies significantly in coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and <unk> than originally thought .

 By the Late Classic , a network of <unk> ( <unk> ) linked various parts of the city , running for several kilometres through its urban core . These linked the Great Plaza with Temple 4 ( located about 750 metres ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) to the west ) and the Temple of the <unk> ( about 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) to the southeast ) . These broad <unk> were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists ; the Maler , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> . They assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams . 
 The Maler Causeway runs north from behind Temple I to Group H. A large bas @-@ relief is carved onto limestone bedrock upon the course of the causeway just south of Group H. It depicts two bound captives and dates to the Late Classic .

 The Great Plaza lies at the core of the site ; it is flanked on the east and west sides by two great temple @-@ pyramids . On the north side it is bordered by the North Acropolis and on the south by the Central Acropolis . 
 The Central Acropolis is a palace complex just south of the Great Plaza . 
 The North Acropolis , together with the Great Plaza immediately to the south , is one of the most studied architectural groups in the Maya area ; the <unk> Project excavated a massive trench across the complex , thoroughly investigating its construction history . It is a complex group with construction beginning in the <unk> Period , around 350 BC . It developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period , with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures . After AD 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Northern Platform , which measured 100 by 80 metres ( 330 by 260 ft ) , gradually hiding it from view . Eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century AD , each of them had an elaborate <unk> and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods . By the 9th century AD , 43 stelae and 30 altars had been erected in the North Acropolis ; 18 of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits . The North Acropolis continued to receive burials into the <unk> Period . 
 The South Acropolis is found next to Temple V. It was built upon a large basal platform that covers an area of more than 20 @,@ 000 square metres ( 220 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . 
 The Plaza of the Seven Temples is to the west of the South Acropolis . It is bordered on the east side by a row of nearly identical temples , by palaces on the south and west sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side . 
 The Mundo <unk> is to the west of the Plaza of the Seven Temples . It is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the <unk> period at <unk> . The complex was organized as a large E @-@ Group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported three temples . The Mundo <unk> complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history . By AD 250 – 300 its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of <unk> in the Valley of Mexico , including the use of the <unk> @-@ <unk> form . During the Early Classic period ( c . 250 – 600 ) the Mundo <unk> became one of the twin <unk> of the city , the other being the North Acropolis . From AD 250 to <unk> it may have served as the royal necropolis . The Mundo <unk> complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the University of Pennsylvania ; it is centered upon the Lost World Pyramid and a small platform to the west of it . 
 Group G lies just south of the <unk> Causeway . The complex dates to the Late Classic and consists of palace @-@ type structures and is one of the largest groups of its type at <unk> . It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor , a total of 29 vaulted chambers . The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey . One of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask . 
 Group H is centered on a large plaza to the north of the Great Plaza . It is bordered by temples dating to the Late Classic . 
 There are nine Twin @-@ Pyramid <unk> at <unk> , one of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed . They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east – west axis . These pyramids are flat @-@ topped and have <unk> on all four sides . A row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids , and lying roughly <unk> from them , there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair . On the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine <unk> . The entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at 20 @-@ year ( or k <unk> ) intervals during the Late Classic . The first twin pyramid complex was built in the early 6th century in the East Plaza . It was once thought that these complexes were unique to <unk> but rare examples have now been found at other sites , such as <unk> and <unk> , and they may reflect the extent of <unk> 's political dominance in the Late Classic . 
 Group Q is a twin @-@ pyramid complex , and is one of the largest at <unk> . It was built by <unk> <unk> <unk> II in <unk> in order to mark the end of the 17th K <unk> . Most of it has been restored and its monuments have been re @-@ erected . 
 Group R is another twin @-@ pyramid complex , dated to 790 . It is close to the Maler Causeway .

 There are thousands of ancient structures at <unk> and only a fraction of these have been excavated , after decades of archaeological work . The most prominent surviving buildings include six very large pyramids , labelled Temples I - VI , each of which support a temple structure on their <unk> . Some of these pyramids are over 60 metres ( 200 feet ) high . They were numbered <unk> during the early survey of the site . It is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as two years . 
 Temple I ( also known as the Temple of <unk> <unk> or Temple of the Great Jaguar ) is a funerary pyramid dedicated to <unk> Chan K <unk> , who was <unk> in the structure in AD <unk> , the pyramid was completed around 740 – 750 . The temple rises 47 metres ( 154 ft ) high . The massive <unk> that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king , although little of this decoration survives . The tomb of the king was discovered by Aubrey <unk> of the University of Pennsylvania in 1962 . Among items recovered from the Late Classic tomb were a large collection of inscribed human and animal bone tubes and strips with sophisticated scenes depicting deities and people , finely carved and rubbed with <unk> , as well as <unk> and shell ornaments and ceramic vessels filled with offerings of food and drink . The shrine at the summit of the pyramid has three chambers , each behind the next , with the <unk> spanned by wooden <unk> fashioned from multiple beams . The outermost <unk> is plain but the two inner <unk> were carved , some of the beams were removed in the 19th century and their location is unknown , while others were taken to museums in Europe . 
 Temple II ( also known as the Temple of the Mask ) it was built around AD 700 and stands 38 metres ( 125 ft ) high . Like other major temples at <unk> , the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the <unk> spanned by wooden <unk> , only the middle of which was carved . The temple was dedicated to the wife of <unk> Chan K <unk> , although no tomb was found . The queen 's portrait was carved into the <unk> spanning the doorway of the summit shrine . One of the beams from this <unk> is now in the American Museum of Natural History in New York . 
 Temple III ( also known as the Temple of the Jaguar Priest ) was the last of the great pyramids to be built at <unk> . It stood 55 metres ( 180 ft ) tall and contained an elaborately sculpted but damaged roof <unk> , possibly showing Dark Sun engaged in a ritual dance around AD <unk> . The temple shrine possesses two chambers . 
 Temple IV is the tallest temple @-@ pyramid at <unk> , measuring 70 metres ( 230 ft ) from the plaza floor level to the top of its roof comb . Temple IV marks the reign of <unk> ’ in Chan <unk> ( Ruler B , the son of Ruler A or <unk> Chan K 'awiil I ) and two carved wooden <unk> over the doorway that leads into the temple on the pyramid ’ s summit record a long count date ( 9 @.@ 15 @.@ 10 @.@ 0 @.@ 0 ) that corresponds to CE <unk> ( <unk> 1994 : 169 ) . Temple IV is the largest pyramid built anywhere in the Maya region in the 8th century , and as it currently stands is the tallest pre @-@ Columbian structure in the Americas although the Pyramid of the Sun at <unk> may originally have been taller , as may have been one of the structures at El <unk> . 
 Temple V stands south of the Central Acropolis and is the mortuary pyramid of an as yet unidentified ruler . The temple stands 57 metres ( 187 ft ) high , making it the second tallest structure at <unk> - only Temple IV is taller . The temple has been dated to about AD 700 , in the Late Classic period , via <unk> analysis and the dating of ceramics associated with the structure places its construction during the reign of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the second half of the 7th century . 
 Temple VI is also known as the Temple of the <unk> and was dedicated in AD <unk> . It is notable for its 12 @-@ metre ( 39 ft ) high roof @-@ comb . <unk> of hieroglyphs cover the back and sides of the roof @-@ comb . The temple faces onto a plaza to the west and its front is <unk> . 
 Temple 33 was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of <unk> Chan K 'awiil I ( known as <unk> 48 ) in the North Acropolis . It started life in the Early Classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway . Later in the Early Classic a new superstructure was added , with its own masks and decorated panels . During the Hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions , the stairway was demolished and another royal burial , of an unidentified ruler , was set into the structure ( <unk> 23 ) . While the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb ( <unk> 24 ) was inserted into the rubble core of the building . The pyramid was then completed , standing 33 metres ( 108 ft ) tall . The final version of Temple 33 was completely dismantled by archaeologists in 1965 in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction . 
 Structure 34 is a pyramid in the North Acropolis that was built by <unk> Chan K 'awiil II over the tomb of his father , <unk> <unk> <unk> I. The pyramid was topped by a three chambered shrine , the rooms situated one behind the other . 
 Structure <unk> @-@ 43 is an unusual radial temple in the East Plaza , built over a pre @-@ existing twin pyramid complex . It is built into the end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry <unk> and three <unk> , the fourth ( south ) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side . The building has a <unk> @-@ <unk> platform profile , modified from the original style found at <unk> . In fact , it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer <unk> with El <unk> and <unk> than with <unk> itself . The vertical <unk> panels are set between sloping <unk> panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols . Large flower symbols are set into the sloping <unk> panels , related to the Venus and star symbols used at <unk> . The roof of the structure was decorated with <unk> although only fragments now remain , showing a monstrous face , perhaps that of a jaguar , with another head emerging from the mouth . The second head possesses a <unk> tongue but is probably not that of a snake . The temple , and its associated ballcourt , probably date to the reign of <unk> <unk> Chaak or that of his son <unk> Chan K 'awiil I , in the later part of the 7th century . 
 Structure <unk> @-@ 49 possesses a clear <unk> @-@ linked architectural style ; it has <unk> , an architectural feature that is very rare in the Maya region , and a <unk> @-@ <unk> façade ; it dates to the 4th century AD . It is located near to the Lost World pyramid . 
 Structure <unk> @-@ 53 is a small <unk> @-@ style platform that dates to about AD 600 . It had <unk> on all four sides and did not possess a superstructure . 
 The Lost World Pyramid ( Structure <unk> @-@ 54 ) is the largest structure in the Mundo <unk> complex . It lies in the southwest portion of <unk> ’ s central core , south of Temple III and west of Temple V. It was decorated with stucco masks of the sun god and dates to the Late <unk> ; this pyramid is part of an enclosed complex of structures that remained intact and un @-@ impacted by later building activity at <unk> . By the end of the Late <unk> this pyramid was one of the largest structures in the Maya region . It attained its final form during the reign of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak in the 4th century AD , in the Early Classic , standing more than 30 metres ( 98 ft ) high with <unk> on all four sides and a flat top that possibly supported a superstructure built from <unk> materials . Although the plaza later suffered significant alteration , the organization of a group of temples on the east side of this complex <unk> to the layout that defines the so @-@ called E @-@ Groups , identified as solar observatories . 
 Structure <unk> @-@ 96 is the central temple on the east side of the Plaza of the Seven Temples . It has been restored and its rear outer wall is decorated with skull @-@ and @-@ <unk> motifs . 
 Group <unk> @-@ 16 is an elite residential complex that has been thoroughly excavated . It lies a few hundred metres south of the Lost World Complex and the excavations have revealed elaborate stucco masks , <unk> murals , relief sculptures and buildings with <unk> characteristics . 
 The Great Plaza Ballcourt is a small ballcourt that lies between Temple I and the Central Acropolis . 
 The Bat Palace is also known as the Palace of Windows and lies to the west of Temple III . It has two <unk> , with a double range of chambers on the lower storey and a single range in the upper storey , which has been restored . The palace has ancient graffiti and possesses low windows . 
 Complex N lies to the west of the Bat Palace and Temple III . The complex dates to AD 711 .

 Altar 5 is carved with two nobles , one of whom is probably <unk> Chan K 'awiil I. They are performing a ritual using the bones of an important woman . Altar 5 was found in Complex N , which lies to the west of Temple III . 
 Altar 8 is sculpted with a bound captive . It was found within Complex P in Group H and is now in the <unk> <unk> de <unk> y <unk> in Guatemala City . 
 Altar 9 is associated with Stela 21 and bears the sculpture of a bound captive . It is located in front of Temple VI . 
 Altar 10 is carved with a captive tied to a <unk> . It is in the northern enclosure of Group Q , a twin @-@ pyramid complex and has suffered from erosion . 
 Altar 35 is a plain monument associated with Stela 43 . The stela @-@ altar pair is <unk> located at the base of the stairway of Temple IV .

 Stelae are carved stone shafts , often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs . A selection of the most notable stelae at <unk> follows : 
 Stela 1 dates to the 5th century and depicts the king <unk> Chan K 'awiil II in a standing position . 
 Stela 4 is dated to AD <unk> , during the reign of <unk> <unk> <unk> after the intrusion of <unk> in the Maya area . The stela displays a mix of Maya and <unk> qualities , and deities from both cultures . It has a portrait of the king with the <unk> Jaguar God under one arm and the Mexican <unk> under the other . His helmet is a simplified version of the <unk> War <unk> . Unusually for Maya sculpture , but typically for <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> is depicted with a frontal face , rather than in profile . 
 Stela 5 was dedicated in <unk> by <unk> 'in Chan K 'awiil . 
 Stela 6 is a badly damaged monument dating to <unk> and bears the name of the " Lady of <unk> " who celebrated the end of the 4th K <unk> in that year . 
 Stela 10 is twinned with Stela 12 but is badly damaged . It described the accession of <unk> ' B <unk> in the early 6th century and earlier events in his career , including the capture of a prisoner depicted on the monument . 
 Stela 11 was the last monument ever erected at <unk> ; it was dedicated in <unk> by <unk> Chan K 'awiil II . 
 Stela 12 is linked to the queen known as the " Lady of <unk> " and king <unk> ' B <unk> . The queen is described as performing the year @-@ ending rituals but the monument was dedicated in honor of the king . 
 Stela 16 was dedicated in 711 , during the reign of <unk> Chan K 'awiil I. The sculpture , including a portrait of the king and a hieroglyphic text , are limited to the front face of the monument . It was found in Complex N , west of Temple III . 
 Stela 18 was one of two stelae erected by <unk> <unk> <unk> I to celebrate the k <unk> @-@ ending of AD <unk> . It was re @-@ erected at the base of Temple 34 , his funerary shrine . 
 Stela 19 was dedicated in 790 by <unk> <unk> <unk> II . 
 Stela 20 was found in Complex P , in Group H , and was moved to the <unk> <unk> de <unk> y <unk> in Guatemala City . 
 Stela 21 was dedicated in <unk> by <unk> 'in Chan K 'awiil . Only the bottom of the stela is intact , the rest having been <unk> in ancient times . The surviving sculpture is of fine quality , consisting of the feet of a figure and of accompanying hieroglyphic text . The stela is associated with Altar 9 and is located in front of Temple VI . 
 Stela 22 was dedicated in <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> II in the northern enclosure of Group Q , a twin @-@ pyramid complex . The face of the figure on the stela has been <unk> . 
 Stela 23 was broken in antiquity and was re @-@ erected in a residential complex . The defaced portrait on the monument is that of the so @-@ called " Lady of <unk> " , a daughter of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak II who became queen at the age of six but never ruled in her own right , being paired with male co @-@ rulers . It dates to the early 6th century . 
 Stela 24 was erected at the foot of Temple 3 in <unk> , accompanied by Altar 7 . Both were broken into fragments in ancient times , although the name of Dark Sun survives on three fragments . 
 Stela 26 was found in the summit shrine of Temple 34 , underneath a broken masonry altar . The monument had originally been erected at the base of the temple during the Early Classic period and was later broken , probably at the beginning of the Late Classic . Its remains were then interred within the temple shrine . 
 Stela 29 bears a Long Count ( 8 @.@ 12 @.@ 14 @.@ 8 @.@ 15 ) date equivalent to AD <unk> , the earliest surviving Long Count date from the Maya lowlands . The stela is also the earliest monument to bear the <unk> emblem glyph . It bears a sculpture of the king facing to the right , holding the head of an underworld jaguar god , one of the patron deities of the city . The stela was deliberately smashed during the 6th century or some time later , the upper portion was dragged away and dumped in a rubbish tip close to Temple III , to be uncovered by archaeologists in 1959 . 
 Stela 30 is the first surviving monument to be erected after the Hiatus . Its style and iconography is similar to that of <unk> , one of the more important of <unk> 's enemies . 
 Stela 31 is the accession monument of <unk> Chan K 'awiil II , also bearing two portraits of his father , <unk> <unk> <unk> , as a youth dressed as a <unk> warrior . He carries a <unk> in one hand and bears a shield decorated with the face of <unk> , the <unk> war god . In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple 33 and <unk> buried . Stela 31 has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at <unk> . A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument , the longest to survive from the Early Classic , which describes the arrival of <unk> K <unk> ' at El Peru and <unk> in January <unk> . It was also the first stela at <unk> to be carved on all four faces . 
 Stela 32 is a fragmented monument with a foreign <unk> @-@ style sculpture apparently depicting the lord of that city with the attributes of the central Mexican storm god <unk> , including his <unk> eyes and <unk> headdress . 
 Stela 39 is a broken monument that was erected in the Lost World complex . The upper portion of the stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak , holding a flint axe in his left hand . He is <unk> the figure of a bound , richly dressed captive . The monument is dated to AD <unk> . The text on the back of the monument describes a <unk> ritual to celebrate a <unk> @-@ ending . The stela also names <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak I 's father as K 'inich <unk> <unk> . 
 Stela 40 bears a portrait of Kan <unk> and dates to AD 468 . 
 Stela 43 is paired with Altar 35 . It is a plain monument at the base of the stairway of Temple IV .

 <unk> 1 is a tomb in the Lost World complex . A fine ceramic bowl was recovered from the tomb , with the handle formed from three @-@ dimensional head and neck of a bird emerging from the two @-@ dimensional body painted on the <unk> . 
 <unk> 10 is the tomb of <unk> <unk> <unk> . It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis . The tomb contained a rich array of offerings , including ceramic vessels and food , and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king . A dog was also <unk> with the deceased king . <unk> in the tomb were <unk> and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and <unk> styles . Among the offerings was an incense @-@ <unk> in the shape of an elderly underworld god , sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands . The tomb was sealed with a <unk> vault , then the pyramid was built on top . 
 <unk> 48 is generally accepted as the tomb of <unk> Chan K <unk> . It is located beneath Temple 33 in the North Acropolis . The chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained the remains of the king himself together with those of two <unk> who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler . The walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to 20 March 457 , probably the date of either the death or interment of the king . The king 's skeleton was missing its skull , its <unk> and one of its hands while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact . 
 <unk> 85 dates to the Late <unk> and was enclosed by a platform , with a primitive <unk> vault . The tomb contained a single male skeleton , which lacked a skull and its <unk> . The dynastic founder of <unk> , <unk> <unk> ' Xook , has been linked to this tomb , which lies deep in the heart of the North Acropolis . The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being <unk> by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers . The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle . The missing head was replaced by a small <unk> mask with shell @-@ <unk> teeth and eyes and bearing a three @-@ pointed royal <unk> . This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare <unk> lowland Maya portrait of a king . Among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine , a <unk> shell and twenty @-@ six ceramic vessels . 
 <unk> 116 is the tomb of <unk> Chan K 'awiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid , below the level of the Great Plaza . The tomb contained rich offerings of <unk> , ceramics , shell and works of art . The body of the king was covered with large quantities of <unk> ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads , as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king . One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate <unk> mosaic vessel with the <unk> bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself . 
 <unk> 195 was flooded with mud in antiquity . This flood had covered wooden objects that had completely <unk> away by the time the tomb was excavated , leaving <unk> in the dried mud . Archaeologists filled these <unk> with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K 'awiil , the wooden originals long gone . 
 <unk> 196 is a Late Classic royal tomb that contained a <unk> mosaic vessel topped with the head of the <unk> God . 
 
 
 = Tropical Storm <unk> ( 2008 ) = 
 
 Tropical Storm <unk> was the tenth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season . <unk> developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the African coast on August 31 . The wave quickly became organized and was declared Tropical Depression Ten while located 170 mi ( 270 km ) to the south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde Islands on September 2 . The depression was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm <unk> around noon the same day . Over the next several days , <unk> moved in a general west @-@ northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on September 3 . Strong wind shear , some due to the outflow of Hurricane Ike , and dry air caused the storm to weaken . On September 6 , the combination of wind shear , dry air , and cooling waters caused <unk> to weaken into a tropical depression . <unk> deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm . The low ultimately dissipated while located 520 mi ( 835 km ) east of <unk> on September 10 . However , the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of St. Croix .

 Tropical Storm <unk> formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa near the end of August 2008 . It tracked south of Cape Verde and slowly developed , and on September 2 the disturbance became Tropical Depression Ten while located south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde islands . As the depression became more organized , an eye @-@ like feature developed in the upper levels of the system . The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm <unk> six hours after forming . <unk> was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly . 
 <unk> continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical . However , due to the location of the storm , there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings , and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity . Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm , the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification . The storm was also heading into an area where shear was <unk> to significantly increase due to an upper @-@ level trough diving southward . Despite convection being partially removed from the center of <unk> , the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September 3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized . The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening , causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger . 
 <unk> reached its peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) around 8 a.m. ( <unk> ) as it continued to become more organized . However , there were indications that it had already begun to weaken . <unk> towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm , a sign that dry air was entering the system . During the afternoon hours , the structure of <unk> began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll . By the late night , the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center . 
 Despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep burst of convection formed in the northern <unk> of <unk> . The center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity . The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as <unk> continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5 @-@ day forecast was predicted . However , the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and <unk> weakened again . By the afternoon , the center of <unk> was only a <unk> of clouds , devoid of convection . During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5 , convection associated with <unk> began to <unk> somewhat , mostly to the north of the circulation , due to the strong <unk> wind shear . By mid @-@ morning , <unk> re @-@ intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection . However , the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on <unk> by late morning . The convection around the system became <unk> from the center and <unk> weakened slightly . 
 The weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong <unk> shear . <unk> became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid @-@ afternoon and the storm weakened to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , barely holding on to tropical storm status . <unk> regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours , but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm . Due to the lack of convection , <unk> was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at <unk> ( <unk> ) with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . Since there was no convection around the system , it would have normally been classified a remnant low but , due to the possibility of the storm <unk> over the next several days , it was considered a tropical depression . The next morning , <unk> was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm . No redevelopment was expected with <unk> as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated . 
 However , the remnant low associated with <unk> began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7 . <unk> around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again . <unk> around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of <unk> deteriorating into an open wave . However , on September 10 , the remnants of <unk> redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system . Once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of <unk> headed towards the Bahamas . However , on September 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely . 
 
 = = Impact = = 
 
 As <unk> passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands on September 2 , outer rain bands produced minor rainfall , totaling around 0 @.@ 55 inches ( 14 mm ) . There were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor . 
 Several days after the low dissipated , the remnant moisture from <unk> brought showers and thunderstorms to St. Croix where up to 1 in ( 25 @.@ 4 mm ) of rain fell . The heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding . No known damage was caused by the flood .

 Mount <unk> is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of North America and the highest point in the U.S. state of Colorado and the entire Mississippi River drainage basin . The ultra @-@ prominent 14 @,@ 440 @-@ foot ( <unk> @.@ 2 m ) <unk> is the highest peak in the <unk> Range and the second @-@ highest summit in the contiguous United States after Mount Whitney . Mount <unk> is located in San Isabel National Forest , 12 @.@ 1 miles ( 19 @.@ 4 km ) southwest ( bearing 223 ° ) of the City of <unk> in Lake County , Colorado . 
 The mountain was named in honor of Colorado statesman Samuel <unk> <unk> , who was active in the formative period of the state and Governor of the Territory of Colorado from 1873 to 1874 . Henry W. <unk> of the <unk> Survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak , in 1874 . The <unk> and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class 1 to 2 or A + in <unk> <unk> . Mount <unk> is therefore often referred to as the " gentle giant " that tops all others in the Rocky Mountains .

 Mount <unk> is visible to the southwest of <unk> , often snow @-@ capped even in the summer . Many other <unk> surround <unk> in all directions , and it is very close to central Colorado 's Collegiate <unk> . The neighboring Mount Massive , to the north , is the second @-@ highest peak in the Rocky Mountains and the third @-@ highest in the contiguous United States , and La Plata Peak , to the south , is the fifth @-@ highest in the Rockies . The community of Twin Lakes lies at the base of Mount <unk> , Denver is about 130 miles ( <unk> km ) to the east , <unk> is 50 miles ( 80 km ) to the north , and <unk> is 40 miles ( 64 km ) to the west . <unk> , about 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the northeast , is the nearest large town . <unk> 's parent peak is Mount Whitney in California . Including Alaska and Hawaii , Mount <unk> is the fourteenth @-@ highest mountain in the United States . 
 Weather conditions often change rapidly , and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the <unk> ; <unk> and snow are possible year @-@ round . An electrical storm on the mountain 's summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the July 1894 issue of Science .

 Mount <unk> is part of the <unk> Range , an <unk> of the Laramide <unk> which separated from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago . The tops of this range were heavily <unk> , leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues . For example , the base of <unk> on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and <unk> rocks deposited when the glaciers <unk> , which lie on a lateral <unk> . Further up the eastern side there is a large <unk> with a small <unk> . There are also lakes to both the north and south , <unk> and Twin Lakes respectively ; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines , and <unk> Lake was created by the <unk> Sugar <unk> Dam . 
 Mount <unk> is composed largely of <unk> . However , the summit ridge consists of <unk> basement rock , which is Pre @-@ <unk> in origin and about 1 @.@ 7 billion years old . There are various igneous <unk> including <unk> , as well as " bands " of <unk> and <unk> . Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere , <unk> lacks both a permanent <unk> and a prominent north @-@ facing <unk> , which can be attributed to its position amongst other mountains of similar height , causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 Mount <unk> was named by miners in honor of Samuel <unk> <unk> , the governor of the then @-@ Territory of Colorado , because he brokered a treaty in September 1873 with the <unk> tribe that opened up more than 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 12 @,@ 000 km2 ) of reservation land to mining and railroad activity . The first recorded ascent of the peak was by <unk> <unk> in 1874 , who was surveying the mountain as part of the <unk> Survey . 
 Originally measured as 14 @,@ <unk> feet ( 4 @,@ <unk> m ) in height , Mount <unk> 's elevation was later adjusted to 14 @,@ 440 feet ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) following a re @-@ evaluation of mapped elevations , which sparked protests . The actual change was made in 1988 as a result of the North American <unk> <unk> of 1988 ; it seems the original measurement resulted from the Sea Level <unk> of 1929 . A matter of some contention arose after the Great Depression over the heights of <unk> and its neighbor , Mount Massive , which differ in elevation by only 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . This led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height , only to have the Mount <unk> proponents <unk> them . The effort was ultimately unsuccessful and Mount <unk> has remained the highest peak in Colorado . The first <unk> ascent of <unk> occurred in 1949 , when a Jeep was driven to the summit , apparently to judge suitability for skiing development .

 The summit of Mount <unk> is an alpine environment , featuring plants such as <unk> <unk> ( sky @-@ pilot ) , <unk> <unk> ( old @-@ man @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mountain ) , and <unk> <unk> ( alpine <unk> ) .

 Some of the fauna reported on the climb to the summit include black bears , <unk> , mule deer , <unk> , and pocket <unk> ; there are also many species of <unk> . Elk , grouse , turkey and <unk> sheep are present in the area during the summer .

 There are three main routes which ascend the mountain , all of which gain over 4 @,@ 100 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) of elevation . The standard route <unk> the peak from the east , starting from the Colorado Trail just north of Twin Lakes . The 4 @.@ 6 miles ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) long North ( Main ) <unk> Trail begins close to the <unk> Creek <unk> , and gains about 4 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) . The trail is open to <unk> , mountain <unk> and hunters during season . An easier , but longer route , the South <unk> Trail , is 5 @.@ 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) long , climbing 4 @,@ 600 feet ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) at a less @-@ punishing gradient than the North <unk> Trail , approaching from the south and then climbing the eastern ridge . 
 The most difficult of the main routes is the Black Cloud Trail , a Class 2 climb that takes ten to fourteen hours depending on pace , gains 5 @,@ 300 feet ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) in elevation , and also involves an ascent of the sub @-@ peak , South <unk> , at 14 @,@ 134 feet ( 4 @,@ 308 m ) . Even healthy and experienced <unk> report great difficulty on this route , and despite the fact that there is a trail , the route is extremely steep , unstable , and rocky in places . The elevation gain is not evenly distributed over the 5 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ascent . There are also routes approaching from the western face , and southwestern ridge , from South <unk> Creek <unk> and Echo Canyon <unk> respectively . 
 Although strenuous and requiring physical fitness , none of the conventional routes require specialist <unk> skills or technical rock climbing . The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains , particularly altitude sickness . This can affect anyone , even those who are <unk> . In serious cases , it can lead to high @-@ altitude pulmonary <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which can lead to difficulties with breathing , <unk> , and death . <unk> are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes . Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking , Anna Elizabeth Dickinson , the <unk> , ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government . 
 
 
 = Scientology in Germany = 
 
 The Church of Scientology has been present in Germany since 1970 . German authorities estimate that there are 4 @,@ 000 active Scientologists in Germany today ; the Church of Scientology gives a membership figure of around 12 @,@ 000 . The Church of Scientology has encountered particular <unk> from the German press and government and occupies a precarious legal , social and cultural position in Germany . 
 German courts have so far not resolved whether Scientology should be accorded the legal status of a religious or <unk> community , and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions . The German domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization 's activities . The German government does not recognize Scientology as a religion . It views it as an abusive business <unk> as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the German constitution . This stance has been criticized , most notably by the U.S. government , which recognizes Scientology as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect <unk> . 
 Scientologists in Germany face specific political and economic restrictions . They are barred from membership in some major political parties , and businesses and other employers use so @-@ called " sect <unk> " to expose a prospective business partner 's or employee 's association with the organization . German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late 2007 , but abandoned the initiative a year later , finding insufficient legal grounds . Despite this , polls suggest that most Germans favor banning Scientology altogether . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 Scientology , founded in the early 1950s in the United States by L. Ron Hubbard and today claiming to be represented in 150 countries , has been a very controversial new religious movement . Its stated <unk> aim is to " clear the planet " , to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations . Scientology teaches that the source of people 's <unk> lies in " <unk> " , psychological <unk> acquired in the course of painful experiences , which can be cleared through a type of <unk> called " <unk> " made available by the Church of Scientology . 
 The fact that Scientologists have to pay large fees for <unk> and other Scientology services has brought controversy to Scientology throughout much of its history , with governments <unk> it as a profit @-@ making enterprise rather than as a religion . Critics maintain that Scientology is " a business @-@ driven , <unk> <unk> , totalitarian ideology with world @-@ dominating aspirations " , and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for Scientology courses . Scientology has fought <unk> lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion . These efforts have been partly successful – Scientology has gained recognition as a tax @-@ exempt religious group in a number of countries , most notably in Australia in 1983 and the United States in 1993 , and in 2007 won an important case at the European Court of Human Rights , which <unk> Russia for failing to register Scientology as a religion . 
 The German government has said that it does not consider Scientology a religion , but a " commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism " whose " totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to Germany 's democratic society " . Accordingly , the German government has taken a very strong stance against the organization . Germany is not alone in opposing Scientology ; in France , the Church of Scientology was convicted of organized fraud in October 2009 , after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for Scientology products , and the Church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether . Scientology is similarly controversial in Belgium , Greece and the UK . 
 On the subject of Scientology 's status as a religion , the German government has pointed to a 1995 decision by the Federal Labor Court of Germany . That court , noting Hubbard 's instruction that Scientologists should " make money , make more money – make other people produce so as to make more money " , came to the conclusion that " Scientology <unk> to be a ' church ' merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests " . In the same decision , the court also found that Scientology uses " <unk> and totalitarian practices " . Given the lessons of Germany 's 20th @-@ century history , in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings , Germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power . <unk> in Scientology writings to the elimination of " parasites " and " <unk> " people who stand in the way of progress towards Scientology 's <unk> world " without <unk> , without criminals and without war " evoke uncomfortable parallels with Nazism , and have led to Scientology being classified as an " <unk> political movement " . 
 To further justify its stance , the German government has also pointed to the long history of U.S. court cases involving Scientology , including the conviction of 11 top Scientologists in 1979 and 1980 for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of U.S. government agencies , <unk> and the theft of government documents , a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court finding that Scientology practices took place in a " <unk> environment " , and Scientology 's track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators . In examining the potential threat posed by Scientology the German government has noted that Scientology organizations are " structured so as to make the individual <unk> and financially dependent on a Scientology system " , and that members often abandon contact with friends and family .

 Scientology first became active in Germany in 1970 . By 2007 , there were ten major centres ( " Scientology Churches " ) , as well as fourteen minor centres ( " Scientology <unk> " ) in Germany . The German Scientology Churches are located in the big cities – Munich , Hamburg , Berlin , Düsseldorf , Frankfurt am Main , Hanover and <unk> . Of the Scientology <unk> , nine are in Baden @-@ <unk> , and three in <unk> . Following German re @-@ unification , Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic ; most adherents are found in Baden @-@ <unk> , <unk> and North @-@ Rhine <unk> . 
 Scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or <unk> in Germany ; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology <unk> <unk> <unk> Germany 's domestic intelligence service , the <unk> für <unk> ( <unk> , or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ) , estimates that there are 4 @,@ 000 Scientologists in Germany , down from earlier estimates of 5 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 . The Church of Scientology reported around 30 @,@ 000 members from the mid @-@ 1990s onwards ; this number remained stable for many years . However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12 @,@ 000 members . <unk> in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures , essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses , regardless of their subsequent involvement . The number of <unk> bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred . 
 Scientology formulated a " <unk> Germany " strategy in 1994 – similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries and regions of the world – with the long @-@ term aim of transforming German society in line with the <unk> ideal : a non @-@ <unk> society in which Scientology enjoys <unk> influence . The programme sought to address Scientology 's image problems in Germany , to identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited for political gain , such as Germany 's National Socialist history , and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society , with a special emphasis on <unk> Scientologists into key positions in industry and government . As most religions seek to widen their influence in society , such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort , much like those many religions engage in . However , according to the <unk> , the strategy has not had any significant success . By 1998 , 90 government officials had been suspected of being Scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise Scientology . According to <unk> & <unk> ( 2009 ) , it is unknown to what degree the " <unk> Germany " programme is still being pursued .

 German public discourse does not regard Scientology as a religion , but generally <unk> it as a <unk> ( cult or sect ) , or as an <unk> profit @-@ making venture preying on vulnerable minds . Public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults date back to the early 1970s , when widespread debate took place about " youth religions " such as the <unk> Church , <unk> , Children of God , and the Divine Light Mission . The most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the " sect commissioners " ( <unk> ) of Germany 's Protestant Churches , who also actively promoted the establishment of private " initiatives of parents and concerned persons " . <unk> <unk> ( " Educational Information Campaign " ) became an important organization dedicated to opposing Scientology ; taking an activist stance , it warned people not to get involved with Scientology , filed successful lawsuits against the Church of Scientology over its <unk> in public places , and published an influential book , The <unk> of Scientology and its Front <unk> . In 1981 , the organization 's founder , <unk> <unk> , became the director of <unk> für <unk> und <unk> <unk> ( " Campaign for <unk> and <unk> Freedom " ) , Germany 's most prominent anti @-@ cult organization . <unk> from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with the situation ; as the movements were not doing anything illegal , the government resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious <unk> , the earliest of these publications appearing in 1979 . 
 <unk> by events such as the <unk> Siege in 1993 , the murders and suicides associated with the Order of the Solar Temple , and the 1995 <unk> <unk> incidents in Japan , German fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the 1990s , with Scientology attracting particular attention . <unk> that Scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when Robert <unk> Young , an American ex @-@ Scientologist and former PR official in the Church of Scientology , visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in Der <unk> , a widely @-@ read weekly magazine , describing Scientology as a totalitarian system operating a <unk> – the <unk> Project Force – for members of Scientology 's Sea Org found guilty of <unk> . From the mid @-@ 1990s onward , press articles , reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis , accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience . 
 As noted by the religious scholar Hubert <unk> , Scientology came to be seen as a " serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will @-@ less zombies , but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state " . This view of Scientology as a public enemy , <unk> adds , " became a matter of political <unk> " : senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against Scientology , and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social <unk> . Stephen A. Kent , writing in 1998 , noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed . Scientology was viewed as " a totalitarian , business @-@ driven organization [ ... ] guilty of significant human rights abuses . " Officials examining primary and secondary sources , legal documents , and the testimony of former members , concluded that the organization was " <unk> to a democratic state " . Federal <unk> and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology . 
 Government publications on the dangers of <unk> increased between 1996 and 1998 , and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology . The German courts had approved such publications in 1989 , seeing them as part of the government 's responsibility to keep the public informed , and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom . In 1996 , the German parliament launched an <unk> ( <unk> ) Commission to investigate <unk> and similar groups , in large part because of public concerns about Scientology . Its final report , published in June 1998 , concluded that Scientology , alone among new religious movements , required monitoring by Germany 's domestic intelligence services . 
 An area of widespread concern in the German media has been the alleged " infiltration " of businesses by Scientologists , in line with Scientology 's declared aim to penetrate society , politics and business in preparation for world domination . Attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium @-@ size companies , such as estate agents , management consultants and management @-@ training companies . Management @-@ consultancy firms led by Scientologists often conceal their association with Scientology ; once they have recruited members of their clients ' upper management , these managers may send employees to Scientology trainers , as part of company education and training programmes , without informing them as to the origin of the training methods used . An expensive commercial version of Scientology 's Oxford <unk> Analysis , usually offered free as part of Scientology <unk> in public places , temporarily entered some major German companies ( who were unaware of its <unk> ) via such a management @-@ consultancy firm . 
 In the mid @-@ 2000s , German sect experts expressed concerns that Scientologists were becoming active in the German after @-@ school <unk> market . These concerns arose because customers of around 20 after @-@ school <unk> centres operated by Scientologists in Frankfurt , Hamburg , <unk> and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by Scientologists , using Scientology methods . <unk> advertising the <unk> services would at most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard , the founder of Scientology , but not Scientology itself . 
 In early 2008 , Thomas <unk> , <unk> Commissioner of the German Lutheran Church in Berlin and <unk> , and the historian <unk> Knopp both likened the Scientologist Hollywood actor Tom Cruise to Goebbels , the Nazi propaganda minister . <unk> and Knopp cited a leaked Scientology video in which Cruise was seen asking the audience whether Scientologists should " clean up " the world , the audience responding with enthusiastic cheers – cheers which <unk> and Knopp felt were reminiscent of the audience 's response to Goebbels ' famous question , " Do you want total war ? " <unk> 's and Knopp 's comments found few critics in Germany . Most Germans consider Scientology a <unk> organization . In 1997 , Time reported that 70 % of Germans favoured banning Scientology ; a poll conducted in September 2008 by Der <unk> found 67 % support for a ban . 
 German scholars such as <unk> <unk> and Gerald <unk> have commented that rhetoric dominates public discourse around Scientology in Germany : in their view , efforts to " frame " information in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying <unk> . In <unk> 's words , this includes both the " efforts of German politicians to enhance their popularity with strong @-@ <unk> statements " and " Scientology 's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution " ; commenting on foreign reporting on Scientology in Germany , she adds that " the American press may prefer <unk> news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to American stereotypes " . Both <unk> and <unk> assert that the situation is compounded by the general <unk> of scientific studies of Scientology . <unk> as well as Irving <unk> , Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary in Canada , have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by German scholars . <unk> attributes this situation to the strong influence of the Christian churches in Germany , which has made German academics wary of approaching the subject , because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate . 
 In 2010 a German public broadcaster , <unk> , showed the film Until Nothing Remains , a <unk> account of the effect Scientology had on one German family . Said to be based on a true story , the film attracted widespread media attention and a viewership of 8 @.@ 69 million . 
 
 = = Legal status = = 
 
 While there have been calls for Scientology to be banned , the Church of Scientology remains legal in Germany and is allowed to operate there . Its precise legal status however is unresolved . Two points are contested : first , whether or not the teachings of Scientology qualify as a " religion or <unk> " ( Religion or <unk> ; these are equal before German law ) , and <unk> , whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity ; if the latter were the case , this would most likely imply that Scientology would not qualify for protection as a " religious or <unk> community " ( <unk> oder <unk> ) under Article 4 of the German constitution , which guarantees the freedom of belief , religion and <unk> . Status as a " religious or <unk> community " also affects a broad range of other issues in Germany , such as taxation and freedom of association . 
 The Federal Court of Justice of Germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter , but implicitly assumed in 1980 that Scientology represented a religious or <unk> community . The Upper Administrative Court in Hamburg explicitly asserted in 1994 that Scientology should be viewed as a <unk> community . In 1995 , the Federal Labor Court of Germany decided that the Church of Scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or <unk> community entitled to protection under Article 4 of the German Constitution , although another decision by the same court left the question open again in 2003 . In another 2003 decision , the Administrative Court of Baden @-@ <unk> in <unk> said there were no indications that the teachings of Scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity . In 2005 , the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4 @.@ 1 of the German Constitution , which declares the freedom of religion and <unk> <unk> . 
 Many courts have declined to assess the religious status of Scientology , finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand . The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant , and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities . The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or <unk> community and asserts that Scientology is a profit @-@ making enterprise , rather than a religion . Recent years have seen a number of court decisions in Scientology 's favour , despite the very widespread negative attitude to Scientology among politicians and the general public . 
 
 = = Government surveillance = = 
 
 Given the history of Nazism 's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s , the present German state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution . The <unk> domestic intelligence service ( <unk> für <unk> , or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ) regards the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany 's free and democratic order , and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997 , as have the <unk> for the Protection of the Constitution in a number of German <unk> . Minister for Family Policy <unk> <unk> instituted the surveillance , saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal . 
 The German Church of Scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court . In December 2001 , the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the Church of Scientology Berlin as paid <unk> . The court ruled that the use of <unk> was <unk> . In 2003 , the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report , given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution . 
 At the federal level , Scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the <unk> in November 2004 . The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology , as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings , were incompatible with the German constitution . <unk> acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights , for example , should be restricted to Scientologists , and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti @-@ Scientology legislation . <unk> counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non @-@ political , its aims were the liberation of the human being , and that Hubbard 's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation , and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany . The court disagreed and ruled that many sources , some of them not accessible to the general public , indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the <unk> of the principle of equality and other essential human rights . 
 In <unk> , surveillance was stopped by a court as inappropriate in 2005 , because there is no local branch of Scientology and few members . As of 6 May 2008 , the Church of Scientology in Germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance of its activities by the <unk> after the North Rhine @-@ <unk> Higher Administrative Court in <unk> refused to hear an appeal on the matter . Being suspected of maintaining " ambitions against the free , democratic basic order " , the Scientology organization added a declaration on human rights and democracy to its <unk> . 
 There is at least one example of surveillance of Scientology by the German intelligence services outside of Germany . In 1998 , the Swiss government detained an agent of the German government , charging him with " carrying out illegal business for a foreign state , working for a political information service and <unk> identity documents " . The German government posted bail for the agent . He was eventually given a 30 @-@ day suspended jail sentence for <unk> on Scientology , and the German government apologized to Switzerland for the incident . 
 
 = = " <unk> <unk> " = = 
 
 A " sect filter " , also known as a " protective declaration " ( <unk> ) , is a document that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract . Such sect <unk> , primarily used to screen out Scientologists , have been drafted by German government agencies for use by businesses . " <unk> commissioner 's " offices exist in Germany as part of regional or local government . 
 A work instruction introduced in 1996 requires government staff in the <unk> – local employment agencies and social security offices operated by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs – to mark companies owned by Scientologists with the letter " S " . Where companies are suspected of having Scientologist staff , prospective employees are alerted to this fact by government staff . Government officials have publicised the names of individual Scientologists and conducted media campaigns against their businesses ; some <unk> have placed advertisements in the press saying they are not Scientologists in order to avoid the associated stigma . 
 Due to concerns about possible government infiltration by Scientologists , applicants for civil service positions in <unk> are required to declare whether or not they are Scientologists , and a similar policy has been instituted in <unk> . Companies <unk> for government contracts were likewise required to state they are not Scientologists ; in 2001 , this requirement was changed , and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that " the technology of L. Ron Hubbard will not be used in executing the contract " . When it became known that Microsoft 's Windows 2000 operating system included a disk <unk> developed by Executive Software International ( a company headed by a Scientologist ) , this caused concern among German government officials and clergy over data security and the potential for espionage . To <unk> these concerns , Microsoft Germany agreed to provide a means to <unk> the utility . Following letters of complaint about discrimination from Scientology lawyers , some American companies such as General Electric , IBM and Ford Motor Company instructed their German <unk> to cease the use of protective declarations . 
 The city @-@ state of Hamburg set up a full @-@ time office dedicated to opposing Scientology , the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority , under the leadership of <unk> <unk> . In 2005 , in a case brought by a Scientologist , the Federal Administrative Court of Germany ordered the city of Hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community , finding that the practice <unk> religious freedom . In June 2008 , the Hamburg Administrative Court fined the city of Hamburg 5 @,@ 000 <unk> ( $ 7 @,@ 000 ) for not <unk> with court instructions banning the use of " sect <unk> . " Internet links to sample <unk> to be used by businesses had continued to remain available . <unk> Barker , a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics , has noted that " Germany has gone further than any other Western European country in <unk> the civil rights of Scientologists . " The Hamburg task force was closed down in August 2010 as a result of budget cuts ; <unk> moved to a position within the Hamburg interior authority , where she continues her work on Scientology . 
 Scientologists have been banned from joining major political parties in Germany such as the Christian Democratic Union , the Christian Social Union of <unk> , the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Free Democratic Party . <unk> Scientologist members of these parties have been " purged " , according to Time Magazine . Scientologists have been prevented from running employment and au pair agencies in Germany ; Scientologists who were running such agencies had their permits revoked . In 1995 , a sports scientist and former member of the German national fencing team was dismissed from his job at the German Olympic fencing centre after he stated in an interview that he had enjoyed reading books by L. Ron Hubbard and had participated in a course run by a Scientologist management and communication consultancy firm . Thomas <unk> , a German TV presenter , was falsely accused in 1993 of having taken part in Scientology courses ; <unk> responded by announcing that he had not , and that he would <unk> cease all contact with a friend who had links to Scientology . In 2007 , Günther <unk> , the Minister @-@ President of the German state of Baden @-@ <unk> , expressed concern that Scientologist John <unk> was to appear on <unk> 's programme , and asked the <unk> TV station to consider <unk> the invitation ; the <unk> said that <unk> <unk> would cause greater damage , and that Scientology was not going to be discussed in the programme . 
 In 2010 , the Bavarian Administrative Court ruled that a woman working in a children 's <unk> centre , whose employment had been terminated when her ex @-@ husband identified her as a Scientologist , should be reinstated . The woman had demonstrated to the court 's satisfaction that her <unk> beliefs were irrelevant to her work . According to the agreement that concluded the case , she promised not to use Scientology methods in her work , and to inform the children 's parents of her membership in Scientology . 
 
 = = Initiative to ban Scientology = = 
 
 In March 2007 , it was reported that German authorities were increasing their efforts to monitor Scientology in response to the opening of a new Scientology headquarters in Berlin . On December 7 , 2007 , German federal and state interior ministers expressed the opinion that the Scientology organization was continuing to pursue anti @-@ constitutional goals , <unk> " essential basic and human rights like the dignity of man or the right to equal treatment " , and asked Germany 's domestic intelligence agencies to collect and evaluate the information required for a possible judicial inquiry aimed at banning the organization . 
 The move was criticized by German politicians from all sides of the political spectrum , with legal experts and intelligence agencies expressing concern that an attempt to ban the organization would likely fail in the courts . Sabine Weber , president of the Church of Scientology in Berlin , called the accusations " unrealistic " and " absurd " and said that the German interior ministers ' evaluation was based on " a few sentences out of 500 @,@ 000 pages of <unk> literature " . She added , " I can also find hundreds of quotes in the Bible that are totalitarian but that doesn 't mean I will demand the ban of Christianity . " 
 In November 2008 , the government abandoned its attempts to ban Scientology , after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity . The report by the <unk> cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban Scientology doubtful . First , the <unk> report stated there was no evidence that Scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization ; there were German churches and missions , a German board , German <unk> , and no evidence that the organization was " totally remote @-@ controlled " from the United States . A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a German one . The second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was Scientology 's aggressive opposition to the constitution . Here , the report found that Scientology 's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that Scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow Germany 's free and democratic basic order . " Neither its <unk> nor any other utterances " supported the " conclusion that the organization had criminal aims " . The <unk> also considered whether there were grounds to act against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were <unk> medicine without a licence , but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning . 
 Commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt , <unk> <unk> , Berlin 's interior minister , said , " This organization pursues goals – through its writings , its concept and its disrespect for minorities – that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution . But they put very little of this into practice . The appraisal of the Government at the moment is that [ Scientology ] is a <unk> organization , but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to . " The Church of Scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision , describing it as the " only one possible " . <unk> of Scientology 's activities by the German intelligence services continues . 
 In February 2009 , the Berlin Administrative Court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities on an advertising column next to a bus stop in front of the Berlin Scientology headquarters , warning <unk> @-@ by of the potential dangers Scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom , should be removed . The decision was upheld in July 2009 by the Upper Administrative Court of Berlin @-@ <unk> which ruled that the poster violated Scientologists ' basic religious rights . 
 
 = = Criticism of Germany 's stance = = 
 
 The United States media , while generally reporting negatively on Scientology in domestic news , has taken an at least partially supportive stance towards Scientology in relation to Germany . Richard Cohen for example , writing in the Washington Post , said in 1996 : " Scientology might be one weird religion , but the German reaction to it is <unk> still – not to mention disturbing . " Alan Cowell , writing in the New York Times , wrote in 1997 that the German response to Scientology – motivated by officials ' fear that Scientology " was a totalitarian movement growing , like the Nazi party , from <unk> beginnings " – was itself <unk> of " the Nazi era 's <unk> " . 
 The U.S. Department of State has repeatedly claimed that Germany 's actions constitute government and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of Scientologists ' individual rights posed by sect <unk> . The U.S. Department of State began to include the issue of Scientology in Germany in its annual human rights reports after the 1993 agreement between the Church of Scientology and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service , through which Scientology gained the status of a tax @-@ exempt religion in the United States . That decision also marked the beginning of more intense lobbying efforts by the Church of Scientology in Washington , using paid <unk> . The State Department 's 1996 human rights report on Germany , released in January 1997 , warned that artists and businesses with Scientology connections " may face boycotts and discrimination , sometimes with government approval . " Past targets of such actions had included Scientologist actors Tom Cruise and John <unk> , as well as jazz pianist Chick <unk> . 
 Also in January 1997 , an open letter to then @-@ Chancellor <unk> <unk> appeared , published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune , drawing parallels between the " organized oppression " of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies <unk> by Germany in the 1930s . The letter was conceived and paid for by Hollywood lawyer <unk> Fields , whose clients have included Tom Cruise and John <unk> , and was signed by 34 prominent figures in the U.S. entertainment industry , including the top executives of MGM , Warner Bros. , Paramount , Universal and Sony Pictures Entertainment as well as actors Dustin Hoffman and Goldie <unk> , director Oliver Stone , writers Mario <unk> and <unk> Vidal and talk @-@ show host Larry King . It echoed similar parallels drawn by the Church of Scientology itself , which until then had received <unk> notice , and was followed by lobbying efforts of Scientology celebrities in Washington . 
 U.S. Department of State spokesman Nicholas Burns rejected the Nazi comparisons in the open letter as " <unk> " and distanced the U.S. government from Nazi comparisons made by the Church of Scientology , saying , " We have criticized the Germans on this , but we aren 't going to support the Scientologists ' terror tactics against the German government . " Chancellor <unk> , commenting on the letter , said that those who signed it " don 't know a thing about Germany and don 't want to know . " German officials argued that " the whole fuss was <unk> up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won 't give them : tax @-@ exempt status as a religion . This is <unk> , pure and simple . " Officials explained that precisely because of Germany 's Nazi past , Germany took a determined stance against all " radical cults and <unk> , including right @-@ wing Nazi groups " , and not just against Scientology . <unk> 's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as " absurd " and cited German court <unk> stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a " <unk> <unk> of oppression " . 
 In February 1997 , a United States immigration court judge granted <unk> to a German Scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland . In April 1997 , John <unk> met personally with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a conference in Philadelphia . <unk> later said Clinton assured him that he would " really love to help " with the " issue over in Germany with Scientology " . According to <unk> , Clinton recalled that " he had a roommate years ago who was a Scientologist and had really liked him , and respected his views on it " , stating that Scientologists " were given an unfair hand in [ Germany ] and that he wanted to fix it " . In September 1997 , John <unk> , Chick <unk> and fellow Scientologist Isaac Hayes were heard by the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe ( <unk> , also known as the Helsinki Commission ) , voicing their complaints about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany , and had a briefing with United States National Security <unk> Sandy Berger , whom Clinton had assigned to be " the administration 's Scientology point person " . The German ambassador responded with a letter to the <unk> stating that the German government had come to the conclusion that Scientology 's " pseudo @-@ scientific courses can seriously jeopardize individuals ' mental and physical health and that it exploits its members " , adding that " membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency , to financial ruin , and even to suicide . In addition , there are indications that Scientology poses a threat to Germany 's basic political principles . " 
 A United Nations report in April 1998 raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect <unk> . However , it rejected the comparison of the treatment of Scientologists with that of Jews during the Nazi era . 
 In 2000 , the German Stern magazine published the results of its investigation of the <unk> case . It asserted that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her <unk> application – ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a Scientologist – had in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that of Scientology 's Office of Special Affairs , and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax <unk> at the time she applied for <unk> . On a 2000 visit to Clearwater , Florida , <unk> <unk> of the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority likewise alleged that the <unk> case had been part of an " orchestrated effort " by Scientology undertaken " for political gain " , and " a spectacular abuse of the U.S. system " . German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater , in turn , accused <unk> of <unk> a " hate campaign " in Germany that had " ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of Scientologists " and maintained that Scientologists had not " exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States . " Mark <unk> , a ( former ) top Church of Scientology official , said that although Scientology had not orchestrated the case , " there would have been nothing improper if it had . " 
 In 2003 , Joachim <unk> , writing in the Swiss <unk> <unk> Zeitung , noted that <unk> <unk> , a German Christian theologian , director of the Hannah <unk> Institute for Research into <unk> in Dresden and recipient of an honorary doctorate from Lund University , Sweden , for his <unk> of religious freedom , had been pressured to <unk> publication of his scientific study of Scientology after having found himself the subject of widespread criticism in the German media for advocating a more tolerant attitude towards Scientology . <unk> concluded that " <unk> " had " triumphed " over science and noted an apparent lack of confidence in Germany 's ability to engage in open public discourse on the matter . 
 The U.S. Department of State 's 2012 report on religious freedom in Germany , published in 2013 , stated that " The status of the Church of Scientology remains in <unk> . The Constitutional Court and various courts at the state level have not explicitly ruled that Scientology is a religion . Government agencies at the federal and state level have rules and procedures that discriminate against Scientology as a group and against its members . Four of the major political parties ( the Christian Democratic Union , Christian Social Union , Social Democratic Party , and Free Democratic Party ) ban Scientologists from party membership .

Although courts at the state and federal level condemned the improper use of so @-@ called ' sect <unk> ' to <unk> and boycott Scientologists , they remained in use in the public sector .

 = Japanese battleship Asahi = 
 
 Asahi ( <unk> , Asahi ) was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( <unk> ) in the late 1890s . As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself , the ship was designed and built in the United Kingdom . Shortly after her arrival in Japan , she became flagship of the Standing Fleet , the <unk> 's primary combat fleet . She participated in every major naval battle of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 and was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of <unk> . Asahi saw no combat during World War I , although the ship participated in the Siberian Intervention in 1918 . 
 <unk> as a coastal defence ship in 1921 , Asahi was disarmed two years later to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty , after which she served as a training and submarine depot ship . She was modified into a submarine salvage and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in 1928 . Asahi was recommissioned in late 1937 , after the start of the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War , and used to transport Japanese troops . In 1938 , she was converted into a repair ship and based first at Japanese @-@ occupied Shanghai , China , and then Cam <unk> Bay , French Indochina , from late 1938 to 1941 . The ship was transferred to occupied Singapore in early 1942 to repair a damaged light cruiser and ordered to return home in May . She was sunk en route by the American submarine USS Salmon , although most of her crew survived . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 Combat experience in the First <unk> @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the <unk> École naval philosophy , which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships . Therefore , Japan promulgated a ten @-@ year naval build @-@ up in early 1896 , to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations , with the construction of six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core . These ships were paid for from the £ 30 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 indemnity paid by China after losing the First <unk> @-@ Japanese War . As with the earlier Fuji and <unk> classes , Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships , and turned again to the United Kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme . Asahi , the fifth Japanese battleship to be built in Britain , was ordered from the <unk> Engineering & Shipbuilding Company shipyard in <unk> , Scotland in the 1897 annual naval programme . 
 
 = = Design and description = = 
 
 Asahi 's design was a modified version of the <unk> @-@ class battleships of the Royal Navy , with two additional 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns . The ship had an overall length of 425 feet 3 inches ( 129 @.@ 6 m ) , a beam of 75 feet ( 22 @.@ 9 m ) , and a normal draught of 27 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 3 m ) . She displaced 15 @,@ 200 long tons ( 15 @,@ 400 t ) at normal load . Asahi had a complete double bottom with 55 <unk> compartments . Her hull was also subdivided into 223 <unk> compartments . She was fitted as a flagship and her crew numbered about <unk> officers and enlisted men , including the admiral 's staff . 
 The ship was powered by two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines built by <unk> , Tennant , each driving one propeller , using steam generated by 25 Belleville boilers at a working pressure of 17 @.@ 03 bar ( 1 @,@ 703 <unk> ; 247 <unk> ) . The engines were rated at 15 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 000 kW ) , using forced draught , and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) although Asahi reached 18 @.@ 3 knots ( 33 @.@ 9 km / h ; 21 @.@ 1 mph ) from 16 @,@ <unk> indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 181 kW ) during her sea trials on 23 March 1900 . She carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 000 long tons ( 2 @,@ 032 t ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 9 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 17 @,@ 000 km ; 10 @,@ 000 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The ship was fitted with three steam @-@ driven 4 @.@ 8 @-@ <unk> ( 6 @.@ 4 hp ) <unk> . 
 Asahi 's main battery consisted of the same four <unk> Ordnance Company 40 @-@ calibre twelve @-@ inch guns used in all of Japan 's preceding battleships . They were mounted in twin @-@ gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure . The <unk> powered mountings allowed the guns to be loaded at all angles of traverse , at a fixed elevation of + 13 @.@ 5 ° . Each mount could traverse a total of 240 degrees .

 Asahi , meaning " rising sun " , a poetic name for Japan from a stanza of <unk> poetry , was laid down on 1 August 1898 in <unk> , Scotland , by the <unk> Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. and completed by John Brown & Company , which purchased the firm before Asahi was completed . She was launched on 13 March 1899 and completed on 31 July 1900 . Her completion was delayed by about three months when her bottom plating required repairs after running aground off <unk> following sea trials . The ship departed England , after repairs in Portsmouth , on the day of her completion , and arrived at <unk> , Japan , on 23 October 1900 . Asahi became flagship of the Standing Fleet on 22 May 1901 and was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet when the Combined Fleet was re @-@ formed on 28 December 1903 . 
 At the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , Asahi , commanded by Captain <unk> <unk> , was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet . She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 , when Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur . <unk> had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack . The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser <unk> , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences . <unk> chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns . <unk> his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and six @-@ inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect . Although many ships on both sides were hit , Russian casualties numbered only 17 , while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before <unk> <unk> . Asahi was not hit during the engagement . 
 The ship participated in the action of 13 April , when <unk> successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron , including Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> 's flagship , the battleship <unk> . When <unk> spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division , he turned back for Port Arthur and <unk> struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night . The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded , and <unk> was one of the <unk> killed . <unk> by his success , <unk> resumed long @-@ range bombardment missions , prompting the Russians to lay more minefields , which sank two Japanese battleships the following month . 
 During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August , Asahi , now commanded by Captain <unk> <unk> , was second in line of the column of Japanese battleships , behind <unk> , and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships . She was only hit by a single 12 @-@ inch shell that wounded two crewmen . Both guns in her aft 12 @-@ inch gun turret , however , were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels . In turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships <unk> and <unk> although both ships were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells , which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact . The ship made the critical hits of the battle , however , when two of her 12 @-@ inch shells struck the bridge of <unk> , killing the Russian squadron commander , Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> , two of his staff officers and the ship 's <unk> . The ship 's wheel was jammed to port by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the Russian ships into total confusion . The second @-@ in @-@ command , Rear Admiral Prince Pavel <unk> , eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to Port Arthur . <unk> more than two months later , on 26 October , Asahi struck a mine off Port Arthur while on blockade duty . <unk> damaged , she was under repair at <unk> Naval Arsenal from November 1904 to April 1905 . Russian naval forces in the Far East had been destroyed or <unk> by this time and the Russians were forced to transfer ships from the Baltic Fleet that did not arrive until May .

 At the Battle of <unk> on 27 May 1905 , Asahi again followed the battleship <unk> into combat , this time against the Second and Third Pacific Squadrons . <unk> opened fire at the battleship <unk> <unk> , the Russian flagship , at 14 : 10 , and was joined by Asahi and the armoured cruiser <unk> shortly afterwards . Within an hour the Japanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the Russian ship , badly wounded the fleet commander , Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> , knocked out her rear 12 @-@ inch gun turret , and jammed <unk> <unk> 's steering so that she fell out of formation . The Russian ships were concentrating their fire on <unk> during the early part of the battle and Asahi was not damaged during this time . <unk> was able to cross the T of the Russian squadrons . <unk> <unk> 's steering was later repaired , but she <unk> between the Japanese and Russian fleets several times later in the battle and was heavily damaged . Asahi seems to have mostly engaged the battleships <unk> and <unk> in the late stages of the battle , although Fuji fired the shots that caused the <unk> 's magazines to explode and sink her . Asahi fired more twelve @-@ inch shells , 142 , than any other ship during the battle . In total , the ship was hit six times during the battle , but none of them damaged her significantly . While Asahi 's casualties are not precisely known , the Japanese only lost 110 men killed and 590 wounded to all causes during the battle . The battle was a total Japanese victory with five Russian battleships captured and incorporated into the <unk> . 
 Captain W. C. <unk> , the Royal Navy 's official military observer under the Anglo @-@ Japanese Alliance , took notes of the battle 's progress from a deck chair on Asahi 's exposed quarterdeck . His report confirmed the superiority of Japanese training and tactics and publicized the victory in the West .

 In 1908 , Asahi was part of the Japanese fleet that escorted the American Great White Fleet through Japanese waters during its round @-@ the @-@ globe voyage . The ship was assigned to the 1st Fleet in 1908 and 1910 – 11 . Asahi became a gunnery training ship in 1914 , and was re @-@ armed in 1917 with Japanese guns replacing her original British @-@ made guns . The same year , she was assigned to the 5th Division of the 3rd Fleet . In 1918 , Asahi became flagship of her division and participated in the Japanese intervention in the Russian Civil War . She escorted troop convoys to the Russian Far East and was guard ship at <unk> from January to August 1918 . Asahi was reclassified as a first @-@ class coastal defence ship on 1 September 1921 , and began <unk> in 1922 at <unk> in compliance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty . She was reclassified as a training and submarine depot ship on 1 April 1923 and her <unk> was completed in July of that same year . Her displacement dropped to 11 @,@ <unk> long tons ( 11 @,@ 625 t ) with the loss of her armour and guns , and her speed was limited to 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . 
 The navy decided to convert Asahi into a submarine salvage ship and she began the first stage of her conversion with the installation of specialized salvage equipment from February to August 1925 . From 1926 to October 1927 , the ship 's 25 Belleville boilers were replaced with four <unk> Type <unk> boilers at <unk> Naval Arsenal . One of her two funnels was also removed , and two large lifting frames were installed as part of the second stage of her conversion . The ship conducted experiments in submarine rescue using the old German submarine 0 @-@ 1 ( ex @-@ U @-@ 125 ) . In May 1928 , Asahi was fitted with a 62 @-@ foot @-@ 4 @-@ inch ( 19 m ) compressed @-@ air aircraft catapult on her forecastle and successfully launched an <unk> Type 15 seaplane . After repeated accidents , the catapult was replaced by one powered by gunpowder . On the completion of testing in 1928 , Asahi was placed in reserve . 
 <unk> as a repair ship on 16 August 1937 , Asahi was taken out of reserve in November , after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident that started the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War , and was used as a transport to land troops in an amphibious landing at Hangzhou Bay . Afterwards she began conversion at <unk> , Japan , into a repair ship ; this was completed on 18 December 1938 . Asahi was fitted with a <unk> wooden main battery fore and aft to resemble an old battleship after her arrival in Shanghai on 29 December . In May 1939 she was modified to act as a torpedo depot ship and carried out patrols between 29 May and 7 November 1940 . She was transferred to <unk> Bay , French Indochina , on 15 November 1940 and later transported the 11th Base Unit from <unk> to <unk> Bay 19 November – 7 December 1941 . 
 From 13 March 1942 , Asahi was stationed at Singapore , and in April her crew performed repairs on the light cruiser <unk> , which had been torpedoed by the submarine USS <unk> off Christmas Island . <unk> Singapore for <unk> on 22 May , escorted by the <unk> CH @-@ 9 , Asahi was sighted by the submarine USS Salmon on the night of 25 / 26 May 1942 , 100 miles ( 160 km ) southeast of Cape <unk> , Indochina . Of Salmon 's four torpedoes , two hit the ship in her port central boiler room and aft spaces . At 01 : 03 , moments after being hit , Asahi sank at 10 ° 00 ′ N 110 ° 00 ′ E. Sixteen men were killed in the attack ; the ship 's captain and <unk> crewmen were rescued by CH @-@ 9 .

 John <unk> <unk> <unk> ( August 5 , 1869 – January 9 , 1940 ) was the 35th Governor of Kentucky and a United States Senator from Kentucky . He was the state 's first popularly elected senator following passage of the Seventeenth Amendment . 
 <unk> from a prominent political family , <unk> was chosen as Democrat William <unk> 's running mate in the gubernatorial election of 1899 despite the fact that he was not yet of legal age to serve as governor if called to do so . <unk> lost the election to Republican William S. Taylor , but the Kentucky General Assembly disputed the election results . During the political wrangling that followed , an unknown assassin shot <unk> . A day later the General Assembly <unk> enough votes to give the election to <unk> , who was sworn into office on his deathbed . Taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the Democratic majority in the General Assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and <unk> over the governorship . <unk> ultimately prevailed and Taylor fled the state . 
 Following his term as governor , <unk> made a bid to become a U.S. Senator . His stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of four legislators in his own party and the seat went to Republican William O. Bradley . Six years later <unk> secured the seat by popular election , but he lost his re @-@ election bid largely because of his pro @-@ temperance views and his opposition to women 's suffrage . Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades , he never returned to elected office , failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his <unk> campaign in 1936 . He died in Louisville on January 9 , 1940 .

 J. C. W. <unk> was born at <unk> , near <unk> in Nelson County , Kentucky , son of William <unk> and Julia <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> . His maternal grandfather , Charles A. <unk> , was governor of Kentucky from 1839 to 1840 and served as <unk> general in the administration of John Tyler . His uncle , Robert C. <unk> , served as governor of Louisiana . 
 <unk> obtained his early education at <unk> Academy in <unk> . In 1881 he served as a page in the Kentucky House of Representatives at the age of 12 . Later , he enrolled at Central University ( now Eastern Kentucky University ) in Richmond , Kentucky but was forced to quit school at the age of 17 to support his widowed mother . Two years later , he became principal of <unk> public schools , serving from 1888 to 1893 . <unk> , he studied law at the University of Kentucky , where he earned his law degree in 1889 . He was admitted to the bar , and commenced practice in <unk> in 1893 . He also served as president of the Young Democrats ' Club of Nelson County .

 <unk> 's political career began in 1894 when he was elected without opposition to the Kentucky House of Representatives .

 = = = Governor of Kentucky = = = 
 
 Democrat William <unk> chose <unk> as his running mate in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899 . <unk> was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election , and <unk> 's native Nelson County was already committed to a rival candidate . But friends of <unk> assured him that <unk> would be loyal to <unk> 's reform agenda , whereas the two other men <unk> was considering as running mates would " stack the Senate committees against him . " <unk> was not yet 30 , the minimum age to serve as governor , at the time of his selection . 
 <unk> lost a close election to Republican William S. Taylor . When the General Assembly 's session opened on January 2 , 1900 , the election results were immediately challenged . With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly , the results seemed sure to be reversed . The Assembly was still <unk> on January 30 , 1900 , when <unk> was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building . The following day , as <unk> was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel , the General Assembly <unk> enough votes to give him the election . He was sworn into office from his bed the same day . Three days later <unk> died , never having risen from the bed . 
 Legislative chaos ensued as Taylor refused to acknowledge the Assembly 's decision and <unk> the governorship . The Republicans in the legislature <unk> Taylor 's orders , while the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership . Finally , on February 21 , 1900 , Taylor and <unk> agreed to let the courts settle the matter . The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court , which found in favor of <unk> . Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals , at that time the court of last resort in the state . On April 6 , 1900 , the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court . Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States , which declined to hear the case on May 21 , 1900 . Taylor 's only supporter on the court was <unk> John Marshall <unk> . 
 Following the Supreme Court ruling , Taylor fled to Indianapolis , Indiana , fearing he would be implicated in <unk> 's assassination . <unk> became acting governor , but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the election , a special election was held November 6 , 1900 , to determine who would complete <unk> 's <unk> term . <unk> ( now of age ) won the election over Republican John W. <unk> by fewer than 4 @,@ 000 votes . Shortly following the special election , <unk> married Jean Raphael <unk> of <unk> . The couple had two sons . 
 As governor <unk> sought to unite his party and the state . As part of this effort he supported changes to the <unk> partisan <unk> Election Law , authored by his late running mate while the latter was a member of the General Assembly . He stressed non @-@ controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state 's educational system . He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices , a reform both he and <unk> had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign . However , his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda . The only major pieces of legislation passed during <unk> 's term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state 's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14 to work without their parents ' consent .

 Although the Kentucky Constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms , <unk> announced he would seek a full term as governor in 1903 . His candidacy was challenged in court , but the court ruled <unk> had not served a full first term and was eligible to run . Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non @-@ controversial reforms , he had no significant opposition in winning his party 's nomination . His record also deprived his Republican opponent , Morris B. <unk> , of any significant campaign issue in the general election . <unk> defeated <unk> and three minor candidates . 
 In his message to the legislature in 1904 , <unk> again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law , which had not passed during his first term . The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 session . During the session funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late Governor <unk> . 
 In March 1904 , <unk> signed the Day Law <unk> racial segregation of all schools in Kentucky . <unk> College , a private college in eastern Kentucky that had been integrated since the 1850s , immediately filed suit to challenge the law . The substance of the law was upheld in the circuit court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals . <unk> appealed to the Supreme Court , and in 1908 the court handed down an 8 – 1 decision against the college . Only John Marshall <unk> <unk> . 
 Near the close of the 1904 session , legislators approved the creation of <unk> County from parts of Carter , Elliott , and Lewis counties . Olive Hill was made the county seat . Soon the county 's existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the 400 square miles ( 1 @,@ 000 km2 ) required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties it was carved from to less than 400 square miles ( 1 @,@ 000 km2 ) . Carter County joined the lawsuit , claiming the border of <unk> County passed too close to Grayson , the seat of Carter County , and <unk> , the seat of Lewis County . The state constitution forbade county borders to pass within 10 miles ( 16 km ) of a county seat . On April 29 , 1904 , the Kentucky Court of Appeals found in favor of the <unk> and dissolved <unk> County . 
 During the 1906 legislative session , <unk> urged investigation and prosecution of corrupt insurance companies , following the lead of New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes . In particular , he recommended reducing the practice of deferred <unk> , which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on @-@ hand for illegal purposes . He further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky , <unk> the its economy and providing <unk> some protection against fraud . 
 <unk> refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing Black <unk> Tobacco Wars . He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal , but more probably his reasons were political – the Democrats were dominant in this region and he didn 't want to challenge his own party . By collecting some old Civil War debts from the federal government , <unk> virtually eliminated the state 's debt . Encouraged by the state 's improved finances , the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state 's normal schools , Western State Teachers College in <unk> Green ( later Western Kentucky University ) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond ( later part of Eastern Kentucky University ) . 
 With a successful legislative session behind him , <unk> made a bold political move in June 1906 : he orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and <unk> primaries in November – a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the <unk> election . <unk> wanted the Senate seat , and moving the primary up two years would allow him to secure his party 's nomination while he was still governor . It also allowed him to use his influence as governor to sway the party 's choice of his potential successor as governor . State <unk> Samuel Wilbur <unk> was <unk> 's choice for governor and easily won the early primary over <unk> <unk> <unk> . Former governor James B. <unk> challenged <unk> for the <unk> nomination , but <unk> won by more than 11 @,@ 000 votes .

 <unk> 's term as governor ended December 10 , 1907 . In January 1908 he faced the legislature as the Democratic nominee for a seat in the U.S. Senate by virtue of the primary held two years earlier . The Republicans nominated former governor William O. Bradley . On the first ballot <unk> secured 66 of the needed 69 votes ; Bradley received 64 votes . Seven Democrats had not voted for <unk> . Over the next six weeks , 25 more votes were taken with neither man securing a majority , even though William Jennings Bryan , the Democratic nominee for president , campaigned for <unk> . Some Democrats pressured <unk> to withdraw and allow a more palatable Democrat to run , but he refused . On the 29th ballot , taken near the end of February 1908 , Bradley finally secured a majority after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him . 
 <unk> 's ardent support of prohibition likely cost him the election . His position put him at odds with Henry <unk> , editor of the powerful Louisville Courier @-@ Journal . As governor <unk> had crossed the liquor interests and the political machinery in Louisville . When the Kentucky Court of Appeals <unk> the results of Louisville 's municipal elections due to interference by the city 's " whiskey ring " in May 1907 , <unk> appointed Robert Worth <unk> , a young lawyer and fellow <unk> , as interim mayor until elections could be held in November . <unk> eliminated <unk> in the police department , closed gambling houses and enforced blue laws closing saloons on Sunday . Following this , the whiskey ring announced <unk> had forfeited the support of Louisville 's legislators . In the <unk> election in 1908 , three of the four Democrats who voted against <unk> were from Louisville . Following his defeat , <unk> returned to his law practice . 
 Six years later <unk> again attempted to win the Senate seat . Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment , the senator would not be elected by the legislature , but by popular vote . In the Democratic primary <unk> defeated Augustus O. Stanley , a 12 @-@ year veteran congressman . The Republican nominee was former governor Augustus E. <unk> . <unk> by his support of President <unk> Wilson , <unk> won the election by 32 @,@ 000 votes . 
 <unk> served as chairman of the Senate Committee on <unk> in the Department of Labor from 1915 to 1917 and on the Senate Committee on Military Affairs . In the latter position he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky , Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox . Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I , Fort Knox became the home of the United States <unk> <unk> . When the United States entered World War I , <unk> continued to back President Wilson and supported the League of Nations . 
 True to his <unk> stance , <unk> supported passage of the <unk> Amendment <unk> the import and sale of alcohol in the United States . The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920 . Believing women should be protected from involvement in politics , <unk> opposed the <unk> Amendment , which granted women 's suffrage . The amendment failed on February 10 , 1919 , but passed on June 4 , 1919 . <unk> voted against it both times . 
 The Democrats <unk> <unk> without opposition in 1920 . His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst . Prohibition had destroyed the <unk> industry and the saloon business in the state , and in areas where these industries were prominent <unk> received more than 5 @,@ 000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox . He was also hurt by the women 's vote and by his support of President Wilson , who had lost popularity since <unk> 's election in 1914 . Ernst won the election by fewer than 5 @,@ 000 votes , winning the race with 50 @.@ 3 percent of the vote to <unk> 's 49 @.@ 7 percent . During his single term in the Senate <unk> served alongside three other U.S. Senators from Kentucky : <unk> M. James , George B. Martin and Augustus O. Stanley .

 Following his term in the Senate , <unk> resumed his legal practice in Louisville . He sought another term as governor in 1927 . This time he had the support of the Louisville Courier @-@ Journal , which had been purchased by his ally , Robert W. <unk> . He was opposed by a powerful political machine known as the <unk> Club , whose main interest was securing legislation to allow <unk> betting at the state 's horse <unk> . 
 The <unk> Club ran a candidate in both parties ' primary elections . In the Democratic primary <unk> defeated the Club 's relatively obscure candidate , Robert T. Crowe . <unk> D. Sampson , the Club 's nominee in the Republican primary , won his party 's nomination . In the general election <unk> could not secure the support of Democratic governor William J. Fields , who had been elected with the help of the <unk> Club . Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot , including the race for lieutenant governor , <unk> lost to Sampson by more than 32 @,@ 000 votes . It was estimated that the Club spent over $ 500 @,@ 000 to defeat him . 
 <unk> was expected to be the Democrats ' nominee for governor in 1935 , but the death of his son in late 1934 left him distraught and his wife opposed to another campaign . The Democrats turned to A. B. " Happy " Chandler of Henderson , who won the election . <unk> supported Chandler 's bid , and in return Chandler appointed him to the Kentucky Public Service Commission in 1936 . <unk> also served on the Department of Business Regulations Commission and chaired the State Government <unk> Commission . 
 <unk> attempted to return to the Senate in 1936 . The head of the <unk> Club , James B. Brown , had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930 . In 1933 <unk> 's ally , Robert <unk> , had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , increasing his prominence and influence . <unk> also enjoyed the support of the United Mine Workers and Louisville mayor Neville Miller . The race was complicated , though , by the entry of John <unk> Brown , a Democrat who was a U.S. Representative and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives . He had agreed to support Chandler 's bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler 's support in his run for the Senate . However , Chandler threw his support to <unk> , and while Brown was not able to win the seat without the support of <unk> and Chandler , he did garner 85 @,@ 000 votes , most of them at <unk> 's expense . Democratic incumbent M. M. Logan retained the seat by 2 @,@ 385 votes . 
 <unk> died in Louisville on January 9 , 1940 , and was buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort , Kentucky . <unk> County , Oklahoma , was named in his honor at the suggestion of a <unk> who was serving as a delegate to Oklahoma 's constitutional convention in 1907 . <unk> , his birthplace , was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 16 , 1973 . 
 
 
 = 1888 – 89 New Zealand Native football team = 
 
 The 1888 – 89 New Zealand Native football team was a New Zealand rugby union team that toured Britain , Ireland , Australia and New Zealand in 1888 and 1889 . It mostly comprised players of Māori ancestry , and also included some <unk> ( white New Zealanders ) . A wholly private <unk> , the tour was not under the auspices of any official rugby authority ; it was organised by New Zealand international player Joseph <unk> , promoted by civil servant Thomas <unk> , and managed by James Scott , a <unk> . The <unk> were the first New Zealand team to perform a <unk> , and also the first to wear all black . They played 107 rugby matches during the tour , as well as a small number of Victorian Rules football and association football matches in Australia . Having made a significant impact on the development of New Zealand rugby , the <unk> were inducted into the International Rugby Board Hall of Fame in 2008 . 
 After a preliminary tour of New Zealand in 1888 , the side travelled to England via Melbourne and Suez . The Māori players initially provoked curiosity due to their race , but the British press subsequently expressed some surprise that the side was not as " Māori " as they had expected . Playing their first match , on 3 October against Surrey , the team was subjected to a taxing match schedule , and frequently played three matches per week . Their early matches included a 9 – 0 loss to Middlesex , but their form improved in November , when they won 10 of their 13 matches . The team played its first international match on 1 December , against Ireland , and won 13 – 4 . This was followed by a win over one of the strongest English county teams , Yorkshire , and a 5 – 0 defeat against the Wales national team . By January 1889 the <unk> had played 36 matches in less than three months , winning 22 of them ; they had spent most of their time in the north of England , where the playing strength was strongest and the crowds largest and most profitable . 
 In a return match on 19 January , Yorkshire fielded a stronger side than in the first match and inflicted one of the <unk> ' heaviest losses , a 16 – 4 defeat . The team then went undefeated until 16 February , when they faced England . Officials of the strictly amateur Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) had become increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the New Zealanders , regarding them as unsportsmanlike , and tensions reached a nadir in the aftermath of the England international , during which the RFU secretary George Rowland Hill , <unk> the game , awarded a number of controversial tries to England , prompting three of the <unk> to temporarily leave the field in protest ; England eventually won 7 – 0 . The <unk> apologised afterwards for their behaviour , but the damage was not repaired . The New Zealanders left England without an official send @-@ off , and travelled to Australia where they toured Victoria , New South Wales and Queensland . They then returned to New Zealand , where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before . They went 31 games undefeated before losing their final match , on 24 August 1889 , 7 – 2 to Auckland . 
 The <unk> ' final record in rugby matches was 78 wins , 6 draws and 23 losses . They introduced a number of tactical innovations to New Zealand rugby on their return home , and their tour contributed to the formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1892 . Seventeen of the team 's 26 players went on to play <unk> in New Zealand , and two , Thomas <unk> and David <unk> , subsequently captained the New Zealand national rugby team . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 The idea for assembling a team of Māori footballers to tour Britain was conceived by Joseph <unk> , a rugby player who had toured with the first New Zealand national team in 1884 . He initially proposed a team of Māori or part @-@ Māori to play the touring British side in 1888 ; this developed into a venture to have a Māori team tour Britain if a preliminary tour of New Zealand were successful . <unk> of <unk> 's plans , civil servant Thomas <unk> contacted him to offer help managing the tour , which <unk> accepted . When James Scott , a <unk> , subsequently joined the partnership , the three men decided that <unk> would be the team 's captain , Scott its manager and <unk> its promoter . 
 <unk> started assembling a team for the tour in early 1888 . He had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability , and failed to secure the talented Jack <unk> due to his university commitments . Some Māori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part @-@ Māori . Twenty Māori or part @-@ Māori players joined the squad ; five <unk> ( white New Zealand ) players were added after the team lost to Auckland . Due to the inclusion of these <unk> players the team was renamed from the " New Zealand <unk> " to the " New Zealand Native Football Representatives " . The final squad comprised 26 players ( including <unk> ) ; of these at least five were full @-@ <unk> Māori , while fourteen had a Māori mother and a <unk> father . The parentage of some of the players is unknown . 
 The team toured New Zealand before departing overseas , playing against <unk> 's Bay , Auckland , Nelson , Wellington , Canterbury , South Canterbury , and <unk> . The first game was contested against <unk> 's Bay in Napier on 23 June 1888 . They played nine games in their preliminary tour of New Zealand , and won seven of them . Their last New Zealand match before departure , against <unk> played in <unk> on 31 July 1888 , was won by one try to nil . 
 The team sailed for Australia from <unk> , leaving on 1 August 1888 . In Melbourne , Scott recruited Jack <unk> to train the players in Victorian Rules football in Britain as preparation for possible Victorian Rules matches on their return to Australia . The team played two rugby matches against the Melbourne Rugby Union team , winning the first and drawing the second , before continuing to Britain via Suez . They arrived in London on 27 September 1888 . 
 
 = = <unk> in England and early matches = = 
 
 The team were met in Britain by local rugby administrators , including an official of England 's Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) . The first match of the tour was against Surrey , where the team became the first New Zealand side to perform a <unk> , and also the first to wear an all black uniform . That the team was predominantly Māori provoked curiosity from the British press – at the time , most Britons had not seen non @-@ white people – but there was some surprise that the team were not as " Māori " as had been expected . " They are not unlike Europeans , " a Scottish reporter wrote in November 1888 ; " that is their resemblance is great when one remembers that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation " . The Surrey match , which was <unk> by the RFU secretary George Rowland Hill , was won 4 – 1 by the <unk> after they scored two tries . 
 The <unk> next defeated both <unk> and Kent , before defeats by <unk> and Burton @-@ on @-@ Trent . Both defeats were unexpected , and in the <unk> match , injuries played a part – the tourists played most of the match at least two men down , as replacements were then not allowed . The team recovered to win their next game , against Midlands Counties in Birmingham . Their next fixture was against Middlesex in a match not open to the public , and hosted by the Earl of Sheffield at Sheffield Park , <unk> . The Middlesex side contained a number of international players , including Arthur Gould . Middlesex won easily , with the <unk> play characterised by poor tackling . The final score was 9 – 0 , with three tries conceded by the New Zealanders . Prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine – an indulgence the <unk> were not used to . A report in the Auckland Star had this to say of the game : 
 The New Zealanders expected to meet a mere exhibition 15 of scratch players , whereas Mr Rowland Hill had carefully collected the best possible team available . Such " passing " as the Home men displayed the <unk> <unk> admit they have never previously witnessed . Said <unk> whilst we were on the platform waiting for the London train , " I think they would have just beaten us , even if we had been in good form . " 
 Following the match against Middlesex , the team travelled to the north , where the strongest English rugby teams were based . Yorkshire and Lancashire dominated the county championship until many of their respective member clubs split from the RFU in 1895 over the issue of " broken time " payments . The New Zealanders lost to Hull 1 – 0 , defeated <unk> , then lost to Wakefield . After their first draw of the tour ( against Northumberland County ) they defeated Stockton @-@ on @-@ <unk> and <unk> . Joe <unk> appeared in the match against <unk> , but aggravated the foot injury that had kept him out of the side until that point . These victories were followed by a 13 – 4 defeat to Halifax on 10 November . The team then won seven matches in a row , including one against <unk> RFC , their only Scottish opposition of the tour . The last two matches that month were a loss to <unk> and a 9 – 0 victory over Liverpool and District . The team had played thirteen fixtures during November and won ten of them . By this point , the team was beset by injuries – of the fifteen players that played against <unk> County on 24 November , five had injuries . The squad comprised only 26 players , and the tourists were often struggling to field a side . Nevertheless , their heavy schedule continued ; on 30 November 1888 they left for Dublin , where a match had been organised against the Ireland national team . 
 
 = = Ireland , further English matches , and Wales = = 
 
 The Ireland fixture was played at Lansdowne Road , Dublin , on 1 December 1888 . Both teams had a number of leading players out injured – the Irish were forced to make four changes to their original selection . Ireland led 3 – 0 at half @-@ time after scoring a converted try , but the <unk> improved considerably in the second @-@ half , scoring four tries . Patrick <unk> scored the first two tries , and his play was praised by the local press . The third try scored was by Thomas <unk> after a counter @-@ attack by George Williams . The try was not converted , but the strong finish from the New Zealanders gave the visitors a 13 – 4 victory . The Irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team , but Ireland did go on to defeat Wales two tries to nil in the 1889 Home Nations Championship . Following their defeat of Ireland , the <unk> played Trinity College and then North of Ireland . The match against Trinity College was drawn 4 – 4 , and despite <unk> not playing , the Native side played much better than their previous fixture . The team then travelled to Belfast , where they defeated North of Ireland 2 – 0 on 5 December ; scoring two tries to nil . 
 After returning to England , the <unk> faced Lancashire in Manchester , where they lost 1 – 0 . Two days later they drew with <unk> Bulldogs , despite their opposition scoring five tries . Their next match was against Yorkshire , who were one of the strongest counties in the country , and went on to win the inaugural County Championship that season . Yorkshire fielded a weakened team , and were subsequently defeated 10 – 6 by the <unk> , who scored six tries . After a further two victories , the team travelled to Wales , where they lost 3 – 0 to <unk> , before facing Wales on 22 December . 
 At the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the Welsh team due to fans of both Swansea and <unk> feeling slighted by the lack of selection of their players . Four teams dominated Welsh international selection at the time , and out of the 15 @-@ man team only William Towers and William Bowen of Swansea and Dan <unk> of <unk> had been selected . The match was played in Swansea , and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd , with gate receipts of only £ 120 recorded . The crowd 's hostility impacted on the players , and <unk> Norman <unk> was " <unk> nervous " at the start of the match . <unk> , aged 18 years and 49 days , became the youngest Welsh international player – a record he held until the debut of Tom <unk> in 2010 . Despite the <unk> aimed primarily at <unk> , Charlie Arthur and George Thomas , the Welsh team produced an excellent effort , especially from the forwards . 
 Towers scored the first Welsh try , which was converted by Jim Webb . The <unk> replied with a spirited run by <unk> , but he failed to break through the Welsh defence . The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a <unk> try <unk> the half @-@ way line , which went some way to silence the <unk> from the crowd . Webb , playing in out of position at full @-@ back , missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark . The <unk> continued to push , with Elliot coming within five @-@ yards of the try line , and when <unk> did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25 @-@ yard line before he could touch down . In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander <unk> <unk> the ball into the <unk> ' 25 ; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls , who managed to get the ball across the try line , allowing Jim <unk> to score . <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries , but there were no further scores in the game . 
 The match was also of historical importance because of the Welsh tactics employed . In the 1886 Home Nations Championship Wales had <unk> the four three @-@ quarter system , wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine , and instead employ an extra centre three @-@ quarter . The system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star Welsh player Arthur Gould , whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward . With Gould working in the West Indies , Wales again tried the four three @-@ quarter system against the <unk> , and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system . Within six years the other three Home Countries had adopted four three @-@ quarter style of play . 
 Before they left Wales , the <unk> played Swansea and two other local clubs , Newport , and Cardiff . They defeated Swansea for their first win in Wales , and followed this up with a victory over Newport in front of 8 @,@ 000 spectators . They finished their Welsh matches , and the year , with a 4 – 1 loss to Cardiff in front of a partisan crowd .

 The side entered 1889 having played 36 matches for 22 wins and three draws . The <unk> ' play had improved throughout November and December following poorer form in their October matches ; positive press reports reflected this improvement . The team would go on to play a further 17 matches before their 16 February international against England . January started with a 4 – 1 loss to Bradford , during which 25 police officers were required to keep many of the 12 @,@ 000 spectators , many of them non @-@ paying , in order . This was followed by victories over Leeds Parish Church , <unk> , <unk> Rangers , and Huddersfield . Following further matches against <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , where the team drew , lost , then won , the side faced Yorkshire for a second time . 
 Yorkshire had been criticised in the press for fielding a weakened line @-@ up against the <unk> when the sides first met in December . After the unexpected loss , Yorkshire were determined to make <unk> and a strong side was selected for the county , including Fred <unk> , Richard <unk> and John Willie <unk> , all of whom would appear for England against the <unk> later that season . Described as " knocked about " and " stale " , the <unk> struggled to compete against such strong opposition , and Yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to <unk> left the scores at 9 – 1 at half @-@ time . The second @-@ half was little better for the <unk> ; they conceded a further two tries as well as a drop @-@ goal . The second of these tries was scored by <unk> after he ran the ball from his own half . <unk> scored a converted try late in the match , but this didn 't prevent the <unk> suffering their largest defeat of the tour : 16 – 4 to the <unk> . <unk> later described the match as " without a <unk> , the biggest beating we received in our whole tour " . 
 After a victory over <unk> Valley District , the team travelled west to play <unk> , Devonshire , Taunton , and Gloucestershire , and won all five games . The victory over Somerset was the New Zealanders ' largest of the tour ; they scored nine tries in a 17 – 4 victory . Half @-@ back <unk> played outstandingly for the <unk> , while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition . Devonshire and <unk> suffered heavy defeats by the New Zealanders , before a strong Gloucestershire side was dismissed . After defeating Midland Counties , the <unk> returned to London . 
 The team had two further matches before their international against England . The first was against one of the strongest clubs in England , <unk> . Andrew <unk> , who had toured New Zealand and Australia with the 1888 British Isles side , played for the club in their 9 – 3 defeat to the <unk> . The New Zealanders won having scored four tries , including two by <unk> . Their next opposition was a United Services side mainly comprising Royal Navy players . The <unk> were again victorious , this time 10 – 0 . The match against Oxford University was postponed due to heavy <unk> , and so the team had a seven @-@ day break from playing – their longest of the tour . 
 
 = = England international = = 
 
 The match against England was causing the <unk> ' players and management problems before it had even begun . The team manager , Scott , was in dispute with the RFU over where the match should be played – the RFU were adamant that the match should take place at <unk> 's ground , but Scott wanted the game to proceed at The Oval , where a larger crowd , and therefore higher gate receipts , could be secured . The strictly amateur RFU establishment were already suspicious of the profit @-@ making motives of the <unk> , and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue . The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home <unk> over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board ( <unk> ) . Following a disputed try in an England – Scotland international match in 1888 , the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game , but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote , arguing that they deserved this as they were , they asserted , the senior body , and had the most member clubs . Ireland , Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891 , when , following arbitration , the RFU relented and joined the <unk> . The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the <unk> on 16 February 1889 . 
 The line @-@ ups selected for the 16 February match were both strong , and close to full strength . Though 12 of the England side had not played internationally before , all were experienced at domestic level . The match was <unk> by Rowland Hill , who had also <unk> the <unk> ' first match in Britain , against Surrey . The opening of the first half was a scoreless affair , with much tackling and <unk> on the heavy ground . Later in the half England scored two tries through Harry Bedford , but both were disputed by the <unk> , who claimed that one of their players had grounded the ball in @-@ goal . England took the two @-@ try advantage into the second half . 
 Early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the English . The try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the <unk> and the RFU . <unk> attempted to tackle the English player <unk> , and in the process ripped his shorts off . The <unk> quickly formed a circle around <unk> to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen . While this was happening one of the English players , Frank <unk> , picked up the ball and scored a try . The New Zealanders protested , believing that play had stopped after claiming <unk> had called " dead ball " – but Hill awarded the try , prompting three of the Native players , Dick <unk> , Williams , and <unk> <unk> , to leave the field in protest . The <unk> players were eventually persuaded to return , but not before Hill had <unk> play . <unk> was very critical of Hill , particularly because he was also Secretary of the RFU . <unk> wrote after the tour that " gross as these errors were , they were insignificant when compared with another that Mr Hill committed at the outset of the game , <unk> , <unk> at all in that game " . The disputed try was followed by a final try for the English , who ultimately won 7 – 0 . 
 The RFU , at Hill 's instigation , promptly demanded an apology from the <unk> ' captain of the day , Edward <unk> , who had led the team as Joe <unk> was injured . The English authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question , and that protesting a decision as the New Zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike . The RFU threatened to bar any of their affiliated players – in other words , the entire rugby playing population of England – from facing the <unk> if they did not <unk> . <unk> swiftly sent an apology by telegram , but this was deemed inadequate ; he therefore sent another , four days after the game : 
 The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders ' approach to the game ; reports of rough and over @-@ aggressive play by the <unk> had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain . In the north of England , criticism of the visitors ' <unk> was rarer ; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents , which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south . Some of the <unk> , including Joe <unk> , accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy , claiming that they were quick to <unk> the New Zealanders for rough play , yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players . 
 
 = = Later matches and departure from England = = 
 
 The <unk> remained in London following the England international . They defeated London Welsh on 18 February , before losing first to Cambridge , then Oxford University . From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh . After a win over <unk> , there was a defeat to Oldham , played on a ground <unk> said was so frozen it was dangerous . After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6 – 0 win , the <unk> suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March . The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1 – 1 draw with Hull . <unk> were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists ' last match in northern England . 
 The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain . They eventually played Southern Counties , and beat them 3 – 1 . This was their <unk> match in the British Isles and their 49th victory . The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively , and the <unk> boarded ship without a formal farewell . This perceived <unk> from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London , as well as from the team manager Scott , who felt that with the team 's official apology after the England match , the controversy should have put to rest . 
 
 = = Australia = = 
 
 The majority of the <unk> left Plymouth on 29 March ( <unk> and Pie <unk> followed a week later ) . They arrived in Melbourne in May , where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football , hoping to make more money that way . Although the side had employed Jack <unk> to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles , the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training . As a result , the Victorian Rules matches were a failure ; the players ' <unk> with the rules , combined with the fact that most of the <unk> were rugby forwards ( and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules ) , ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds . The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total , including one in New South Wales , but won only three of them , all against relatively weak opposition . 
 The side 's success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in Victorian Rules – the New Zealanders played three rugby matches while in Victoria : against Melbourne , a Navy selection , and Victoria . The matches were all won , with their game against Victoria a 19 – 0 victory . After this they left for Sydney for further rugby matches , and defeated New South Wales 12 – 9 . After two further victories , the side again faced New South Wales , and won the match 16 – 12 . Another two victories followed , before the team played their only association football matches of the tour – both defeats . 
 The team travelled north to Queensland , where , as in New South Wales , rugby was the dominant code of football . Consequently , the team exclusively played rugby while in the region . The <unk> faced Queensland at the Association Ground in Brisbane . The 8000 spectators witnessed the New Zealanders overwhelm the <unk> to win 22 – 0 ; the <unk> did not exert themselves in the win , and the score did not reflect their dominance . After a further two matches , against <unk> and Ipswich ( both of whom were comfortably defeated ) , the team returned to Brisbane for a rematch with Queensland . In contrast to their first meeting , the first @-@ half was a close affair , and the two sides were tied at the conclusion of the half . Billy <unk> suffered a kick to the head , and had to retire early in the second @-@ half . Following the loss of <unk> , the play of the <unk> improved and they recovered to win 11 – 7 . Not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered ₤ 50 by <unk> to throw the game . <unk> later said : 
 It was on the occasion of this match that four of our players were thought , in racing <unk> , to be playing " stiff " , and that they had been got by some <unk> ; at all events , when accused of it at half @-@ time and cautioned , they played a different game in the second half . 
 The response from the team 's management was to suspend four players . The team travelled to <unk> , where they defeated the locals 19 – 0 . The <unk> included a replacement player for only the second time , Charles <unk> , after the <unk> reduced the playing strength of the side . The team then travelled back to New Zealand , and arrived in <unk> on 5 August . 
 
 = = Return to New Zealand = = 
 
 Two days after their return , the <unk> faced <unk> , who they defeated 5 – 1 in front of a crowd of 2 @,@ 000 . The side suffered further injury , to Harry Lee , and recruited <unk> W. <unk> for their match against <unk> District on 8 August . Despite playing the match two players down , the <unk> comfortably defeated <unk> 16 – 3 . Following the side 's return to New Zealand , the <unk> Rugby Football Union demanded that the team 's management explain the accusations levelled at them in Queensland . <unk> responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted , and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred . The Northern Rugby Union ( since renamed Queensland Rugby Union ) summarised the incident and aftermath in the 1889 Queensland Rugby Union Annual : 
 ... it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the <unk> , as they were not showing their usual dash and combination . Four members of the team were suspended , a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match . The matter was bought before the <unk> Union , who passed the following resolution : That , having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the Native Team , and having received an explicit denial of charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management , we are of opinion that there are no facts before us <unk> the allegations ... 
 It is unlikely , given the attitude of the <unk> Rugby Union to the <unk> before their departure , that they would have dismissed the allegations if <unk> evidence had existed . The side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced <unk> in <unk> . The <unk> <unk> their opponents five tries to two , and won 11 – 8 . The side 's star player and half @-@ back , <unk> , stayed in <unk> when the team departed for <unk> . The side faced <unk> 's Bay , who were touring , in <unk> , and <unk> defeated them 13 – 2 . The <unk> ' play was praised by The Press : " ... the <unk> of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and <unk> between their legs , over their shoulders , under their arms and with their feet " . The side then faced Canterbury on 17 August , who they <unk> 15 – 0 . The report published in The Press said of the <unk> ' performance : 
 The play showed on Saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition of what several months of combination and practice will do ... it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men . In the loose , in the <unk> , <unk> , passing , <unk> , or running they were very much indeed Canterbury 's superior . Such runs as were made by <unk> at full back , by Madigan , <unk> , and W. <unk> , the passing of H. <unk> , F. <unk> , and all the backs as well as several forwards , the rushes of <unk> <unk> , Maynard , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> and <unk> powers of nearly every one , <unk> their opponents ... 
 The side left <unk> and travelled north where they played <unk> in Masterton . The match was won 10 – 8 , and the next day they faced Wellington , who they also defeated . The fixture against Wellington was nearly abandoned because Scott and the Wellington Rugby Union could not agree on a venue ; the match went ahead only when the Wellington officials agreed to cede the <unk> all profit from the match . After this the <unk> travelled to Auckland where they played their last match , against the province on 24 August . The match was lost 7 – 2 after each team scored two tries each , but the <unk> kicked a drop @-@ goal and a conversion . The loss ended a remarkable run of matches – the <unk> had a 31 @-@ game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over <unk> on 9 March ; the side won 30 , and drew one match between the defeats .

 The tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within New Zealand . It was the first tour of the British Isles by a team from the Southern Hemisphere , and the longest in the history of the sport . By the time the <unk> returned to New Zealand , they had developed into a side superior to any in the country , and introduced a number of tactical innovations . Seventeen of the 26 players went on to play <unk> in New Zealand , and two , <unk> and David <unk> , subsequently captained New Zealand . 
 The tour also prompted the eventual formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union ( <unk> , later renamed New Zealand Rugby Union ) in 1892 ; one reason for its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring New Zealand sides . The <unk> sent an officially sanctioned New Zealand team , captained by <unk> , to tour Australia in 1893 . The <unk> are also the <unk> of the Māori All Blacks , a representative team organised by the <unk> , that first played in 1910 . The Native team , along with Joe <unk> , was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2008 – the seventh <unk> .

 <unk> <unk> ( September 20 , 1885 – December 20 , 1958 ) was a Canadian @-@ American <unk> @-@ soprano and voice teacher . She performed and popularised songs by contemporary composers throughout her career and sang in the American premieres of several works by Erik <unk> , Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky , including the title role in the latter 's <unk> . 
 The niece of Lady <unk> and Sir Wilfrid <unk> , who also were her patrons , she initially trained and performed in Europe . She then travelled to Java and for four years immersed herself in its native music , which she introduced to North American audiences on her return . She retired from performing in 1937 , and opened a voice studio in New York , where she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists and served on its board of governors . <unk> was praised for the many qualities her singing brought to music .

In 1906 , <unk> was retained by fellow Canadian singer Emma Albani to accompany her on a tour of England and her Canadian farewell tour . Albani provided a degree of <unk> to <unk> during the 30 week tour of Canada . 
 Lord <unk> awarded <unk> a scholarship in 1906 that allowed her to return to Europe and continue her vocal studies . She returned there and continued both to study and give performances . Her first operatic performance came in 1909 in <unk> , Italy as <unk> in <unk> 's Carmen .

Her accompanying pianist was Paul <unk> , who had previously been the conductor for the <unk> of <unk> , which afforded <unk> a number of opportunities . On permission of the Javanese court , she studied the <unk> , probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity . While living in Java , <unk> travelled extensively , giving performances in China , Japan , Singapore , Malaya , Australia , and New Zealand . She remained in Java for four years , but with the outbreak of World War I she decided to travel back to North America , arriving in New York City in the fall of 1915 .

 Arriving in New York , <unk> struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene . She put on a performance in Vaudeville entitled <unk> , which combined <unk> music with dancers . New York was already home to many North American and European musical performers , so <unk> focused on her <unk> musical repertoire , which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing . <unk> began giving annual recitals at <unk> Hall , and in November 1917 her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers . She developed her own reputation quickly , known as a " ... sensitive <unk> of interesting , <unk> songs " . She gave renditions of three songs by Maurice Ravel . Her performance then also included American premieres of Stravinsky 's Three Japanese Lyrics and <unk> ' Five Poems of Ancient China and Japan . The performance was a great success , and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers . Stravinsky arranged to have <unk> to premiere all of his vocal pieces . 
 <unk> travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America . <unk> there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel , she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him , but also with Erik <unk> and Les six . This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert . She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her , the only exception being a refusal to perform <unk> <unk> by Arnold <unk> . Through this , <unk> performed large amounts of contemporary French music across the United States . She also included American music in all of her concerts . <unk> toured America frequently and returned to Europe in 1922 , and again in 1923 . She began to explore Jazz music in concert as well , earning her negative reviews by many musical critics . 
 Her 1923 annual performance at <unk> Hall entitled " <unk> of Ancient and Modern Music for Voice " became a historic occasion when she presented the works of George <unk> , the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert . The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time . She performed both classical works by <unk> <unk> and Henry Purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Arnold <unk> , Darius <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Paul <unk> . The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment , however . She opened with Alexander 's <unk> Band by Irving Berlin , then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson , and finally finished with three works by George <unk> : I 'll <unk> a <unk> to Paradise , Innocent <unk> Baby , and <unk> . <unk> played the piano for these pieces . Important figures in the audience included <unk> Schumann @-@ <unk> , Virgil Thomson , and Paul <unk> . Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art . 
 <unk> continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences . On some occasions , such as her performances of <unk> in New York in 1923 and 1925 , as well as in London in 1925 , this was quite successful . A critic in Vienna welcomed her musical selection as a <unk> from the usual fare of classical performances - Schubert , <unk> , Wolf , Richard <unk> - while praising her skill with more classical choices . Other performances suffered – she was <unk> while performing works by <unk> Villa @-@ <unk> at the Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music in Venice . She became a celebrity , and continued giving performances across the United States , Europe , and her native Canada . On the <unk> anniversary of Canadian Confederation in 1927 , she gave a performance in Ottawa which was the first <unk> radio broadcast in Canada . Although she toured Canada from time to time , and attended performances of Canadian music in New York , she held a negative opinion of Canada 's treatment of native musicians , saying " Canadians . . . would rather listen to foreigners than their own people .

 Illness forced <unk> to halt giving performances in the late 1920s , but she would return to the stage in 1931 , giving a concert in Havana , Cuba . As time passed she began to engage more and more in teaching , and less and less in stage performing . Her income from teaching was substantially better than from touring . She retired from performing entirely in 1937 , and opened a music studio in New York .

 <unk> was a controversial musician in her time . Her choice of music for performance was often condemned , and often praised . The <unk> of jazz music for a <unk> trained singer , combined with the performances taking place in concert halls lead some critics to <unk> her for promoting otherwise overlooked music , and others to <unk> her for taking <unk> music into a <unk> venue . 
 A May 1 , 1917 review by the New York Times praised her natural talent , with some reservations about the <unk> quality of her voice . Her ability to capture the spirit of the pieces was also praised : " ... her singing of songs by Frenchmen of today and the day before yesterday gave pleasure because of her understanding of them and the appropriate expression which she found for them . " 
 A November 12 , 1923 Time review of her performance of historic Italian songs , as well as modern English , French , Austrian , German and American numbers focused on her choice to include selections of contemporary jazz music . The critic remarked " Her voice was much too good for jazz . " Here she was praised as a serious , scholarly artist whose performance was " ... <unk> and expressive . " The audience received the concert very enthusiastically . 
 Her performance in <unk> in 1923 resulted in a headline in the <unk> <unk> the next day that was headed Eva <unk> ’ s Program <unk> Whole Town <unk> : Many People Are of Two <unk> Regarding Jazz Numbers – Some <unk> <unk> That They Like Them – Others <unk> Silent or <unk> Them . The review divides the audience and critics into various camps : those who openly enjoyed and applauded the performance ; those who openly disliked and condemned it ; those unsure how to react to a performance they liked but felt was inappropriate ; and those who liked the performance but would not show approval for fear of looking foolish or <unk> .

 The Battle of Sullivan 's Island or the Battle of Fort Sullivan was fought on June 28 , 1776 , during the American Revolutionary War . It took place near Charleston , South Carolina , during the first British attempt to capture the city from American rebels . It is also sometimes referred to as the First Siege of Charleston , owing to a more successful British siege in <unk> . 
 The British organized an expedition in early 1776 for operations in the rebellious southern colonies of North America . <unk> by logistical concerns and bad weather , the expedition reached the coast of North Carolina in May 1776 . Finding conditions unsuitable for their operations , General Henry Clinton and Admiral Sir Peter Parker decided instead to act against Charleston . Arriving there in early June , troops were landed on Long Island , near Sullivan 's Island where Colonel William <unk> commanded a partially constructed fort , in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assault . General Charles Lee , commanding the southern Continental theater of the war , would provide supervision . 
 The land assault was frustrated when the channel between the two islands was found to be too deep to <unk> , and the American defenses prevented an amphibious landing . The naval bombardment had little effect due to the sandy soil and the <unk> nature of the fort 's <unk> log construction . <unk> fire by the defenders wrought significant damage on the British fleet , which withdrew after an entire day 's bombardment . The British withdrew their expedition force to New York , and did not return to South Carolina until <unk> . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 When the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775 , the city of Charleston in the colony of South Carolina was a center of commerce in southern North America . The city 's citizens joined other colonists in opposing the British parliament 's attempts to tax them , and militia recruitment increased when word arrived of the April 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord . Throughout 1775 and into 1776 , militia recruits arrived in the city from the colony 's <unk> , the city 's manufacturers and tradesmen began producing war materiel , and defensive fortifications began to take shape around the city . 
 
 = = = British operations = = = 
 
 British army forces in North America were primarily tied up with the Siege of Boston in 1775 . <unk> bases of operations where they had more control , the British planned an expedition to the southern colonies . Major General Henry Clinton , then in Boston , was to travel to Cape Fear , North Carolina , where he would join with largely Scottish <unk> raised in the North Carolina <unk> , and a force of 2 @,@ 000 men from Ireland under the command of Major General Charles Cornwallis . 
 The plan was beset by difficulties from the start . The Irish expedition , originally supposed to depart at the beginning of December 1775 , was delayed by logistical difficulties , and its 2 @,@ 500 troops did not depart until February 13 , 1776 , escorted by 11 warships under the command of Admiral Sir Peter Parker . Clinton left Boston on January 20 with two companies of light infantry , and first stopped at New York City to confer with William Tryon , New York 's royal governor . Major General Charles Lee , sent by Major General George Washington to see to the defense of New York , <unk> arrived there the same day as Clinton . New York was at that time extremely tense ; <unk> forces were beginning to <unk> and evict <unk> , and the British fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions . Despite this , Clinton made no secret that his final target was in the south . Lee observed that this was " certainly a <unk> way of proceeding ; to communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited . " This was not even the first notice of the expedition to the colonists ; a letter intercepted in December had already provided intelligence that the British were planning to go to the South . 
 Clinton arrived at Cape Fear on March 12 , expecting to find the European convoy already there . He met with the royal governors of North and South Carolina , Josiah Martin and William Campbell , and learned that the recruited Scottish <unk> had been defeated at Moore 's Creek Bridge two weeks earlier . Clinton also received pleas for assistance from the royal governor of Georgia , James Wright , who had been arrested , and then escaped to a navy ship . 
 Parker 's fleet had an extremely difficult crossing . <unk> by storms and high seas , the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at Cape Fear until April 18 , and Cornwallis did not arrive until May 3 . After several weeks there , in which the British troops raided <unk> properties , Clinton , Cornwallis and Parker concluded that Cape Fear was not a suitable base for further operations . Parker had sent out some ships on <unk> expeditions up and down the coast , and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there .

 John <unk> , recently elected president of the General Assembly that remained as the backbone of South Carolina 's revolutionary government , organized a defense force under the command of 46 @-@ year @-@ old Colonel William <unk> , a former <unk> and Indian fighter . These forces comprised three infantry regiments , two rifle regiments , and a small artillery regiment ; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies , and the total force numbered about 2 @,@ 000 . These forces were further augmented by the arrival of Continental regiments from North Carolina and Virginia ( 1 @,@ 900 troops ) , as well as militia numbering 2 @,@ 700 from Charleston and the surrounding <unk> . 
 <unk> saw Sullivan 's Island , a sandy <unk> of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) long and a few hundred yards wide , as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from <unk> enemy warships . A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar , a series of submerged <unk> lying about 8 miles ( 13 km ) southeast of the city , and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan 's Island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor . Later it would also have to pass the northern end of James Island , where Fort Johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city . <unk> and his 2nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan 's Island in March 1776 , and began construction of a fortress to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor . The construction moved slowly ; Captain Peter <unk> of the <unk> naval detachment described the site as " an immense pen 500 feet long , and 16 feet wide , filled with sand to stop the shot " . The gun platforms were made of <unk> two inches thick and <unk> with wooden spikes . 
 Congress had appointed General Lee to command the Continental Army troops in the southern colonies , and his movements by land shadowed those of Clinton 's fleet as it sailed south . Lee wrote from Wilmington on June 1 that the fleet had sailed , but that he did not know whether it was sailing for Virginia or South Carolina . He headed for Charleston , saying " [ I ] confess I know not whether I shall go to or from the enemy . " He arrived in Charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor , and took command of the city 's defenses . He immediately ran into a problem : the South Carolina troops ( militia or the colonial regiments ) were not on the Continental line , and thus not formally under his authority . Some South Carolina troops resisted his instructions , and <unk> had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Carolina forces . 
 Square @-@ shaped Fort Sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall , with walls made from <unk> logs 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) high and 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) wide . The walls were filled with sand , and rose 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) above the wooden platforms on which the artillery were mounted . A hastily erected palisade of thick <unk> helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls . An assortment of 31 cannon , ranging from <unk> and 12 @-@ pounders to a few British 18 @-@ pounders and French 26 @-@ pounders , dotted the front and rear walls . General Lee , when he had seen its unfinished state , had recommended abandoning the fort , calling it a " slaughter pen " . President <unk> refused , and specifically ordered Colonel <unk> to " obey [ Lee ] in everything , except in leaving Fort Sullivan " . <unk> 's delaying tactics so angered Lee that he decided on June 27 that he would replace <unk> ; the battle began the next day before he could do so . Lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to <unk> 's Point .

 The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31 , and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day . <unk> noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island ( now known as the Isle of <unk> ) , just a few hundred yards from Sullivan 's Island ; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan 's . By June 8 , most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five <unk> Hole , an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance . With the fort on Sullivan 's Island only half complete , Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls . <unk> believing he would not even need Clinton 's land forces , he wrote to Clinton that after the fort 's guns were knocked out , he would " land <unk> and marines ( which I have practiced for the purpose ) under the guns " and that they could " keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper " . 
 The British fleet was composed of nine man @-@ of @-@ war ships : the flagship 50 @-@ gun Bristol , as well as the 50 @-@ gun Experiment and frigates <unk> , Active , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Friendship and the bomb vessel Thunder , in total mounting nearly 300 cannon . The army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th , 28th , 33rd , 37th , 54th , and 57th Regiments of Foot , and part of the 46th . On June 7 , Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms . However , the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it ( which was flying a truce flag ) , and it was not delivered until the next day . That same day , Clinton began landing 2 @,@ 200 troops on Long Island . The intent was that these troops would <unk> across the channel ( now known as <unk> Inlet ) between Long and Sullivan 's , which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so , while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan . 
 General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions . He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston . He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an <unk> of retreat for the fort 's garrison , but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) channel separating the island from Charleston ; the unwillingness of <unk> and <unk> to support the effort may also have played a role . The Americans also constructed an <unk> at the northern end of Sullivan 's Island , which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons , and began to <unk> a guard post at <unk> 's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan . 
 General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on June 17 . An attempt to <unk> the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder @-@ deep , too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition . He considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the Americans , with timely advice from General Lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position . As a result , the British and American forces faced each other across the channel , engaging in occasional and largely <unk> cannon fire at long range . Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have " the glory of being defeated alone . " The attack was originally planned for June 24 , but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted Parker to call it off for several days .

 On the morning of June 28 , Fort Sullivan was defended by Colonel <unk> , commanding the 2nd South Carolina Regiment and a company of the 4th South Carolina Artillery , numbering 435 men . At around 9 : 00 am that morning , a British ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack . Less than an hour later , nine warships had sailed into positions facing the fort . Thunder and Friendship anchored about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the fort while Parker took Active , Bristol , Experiment and <unk> to a closer position about 400 yards ( 370 m ) from Sullivan 's Island , where they anchored facing broadside to the fort . Each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position , and the defenders returned the fire . Although many of Thunder 's shots landed in or near the fort , they had little effect ; according to <unk> , " We had a <unk> in the middle , that swallowed them up instantly , and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort , were immediately buried " . Thunder 's role in the action was also relatively short @-@ lived ; she had anchored too far away from the fort , and the <unk> of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts . Owing to shortage of gunpowder , <unk> 's men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire , and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons . They also fired in small <unk> , four cannon at a time . One British observer wrote , " Their fire was surprisingly well served " and it was " slow , but decisive indeed ; they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed . " 
 General Clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end of Sullivan 's Island . <unk> by two <unk> of war , the flotilla of <unk> carrying his troops came under fire from Colonel William Thomson 's defenses . Facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire , Clinton abandoned the attempt . 
 Around noon the frigates <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were sent on a roundabout route , avoiding some <unk> , to take a position from which they could enfilade the fort 's main firing platform and also cover one of the main escape routes from the fort . However , all three ships grounded on an <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> became entangled in the process . The British managed to <unk> <unk> and <unk> , but <unk> remained grounded , having moved too far onto the submerged <unk> . Consequently , none of these ships reached its intended position , a piece of good fortune not lost on Colonel <unk> : " Had these three ships effected their purpose , they would have <unk> us in such a manner , as to have driven us from our guns . " 
 At the fort , <unk> ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the two large man @-@ of @-@ war ships , Bristol and Experiment , which took hit after hit from the fort 's guns . Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the <unk> and <unk> . One round hit her quarterdeck , slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh . The shot also tore off part of his <unk> , leaving his <unk> exposed . By mid @-@ afternoon , the defenders were running out of gunpowder , and their fire was briefly suspended . However , Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland , and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships ; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day , telling Colonel <unk> , " I see you are doing very well here , you have no occasion for me , I will go up to the town again . " Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort 's walls with persistent broadside <unk> . This strategy failed due to the <unk> nature of the <unk> wood used in its constructions ; the structure would <unk> , and it absorbed the <unk> rather than <unk> . The exchange continued until around 9 : 00 pm , when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities , and the fleet finally withdrew out of range . 
 At one point during the battle , the flag <unk> had designed and raised over the fort was shot down . Sergeant William Jasper reportedly ran to the <unk> and raised the flag again , holding it up and <unk> the troops until a flag stand could be provided . He was credited by <unk> with reviving the troops ' spirits , and later given <unk> for bravery . A painting of this event ( pictured above ) depicts Jasper 's actions . 
 <unk> casualties , Parker reported 40 sailors killed and 71 wounded aboard Bristol , which was hit more than 70 times with much damage to the hull , yards , and rigging . Experiment was also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded . Active and <unk> reported 15 casualties each . The Americans reported their casualties at only 12 killed and 25 wounded . The following morning , the British , unable to drag the grounded <unk> off the <unk> , set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands . <unk> in small boats sailed out to the burning ship , fired some of its cannons at the British ships , took what stores and <unk> they could , and retreated shortly before the ship 's powder magazine exploded .

 The British did not attempt to take the fort again . Within days of the battle , <unk> learned of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia . The British troops were <unk> on their transports , and on July 21 the British fleet withdrew northward to help the main British army in its campaign against New York City . To add insult to injury , one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by <unk> forces . 
 The British did not return to Charleston until <unk> , when General Clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army . Until the South again became a focus of the war in late 1778 , its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort . 
 Admiral Parker and General Clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle , each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition 's failures . Although Clinton was not blamed by the government , popular opinion held him responsible , and Parker was lauded for his personal bravery .

 Fort Sullivan was renamed Fort <unk> shortly after the battle to honor Colonel William <unk> for his successful defense of the fort and the city of Charleston . <unk> modified in the years after the battle , it was <unk> by Fort <unk> as the principal defense of Charleston prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War . In 1876 , to celebrate the centennial , companies from Savannah , Augusta , <unk> , Columbia , New York and Boston were invited to Charleston . The site was turned over to the National Park Service in 1960 , and is now part of Fort <unk> National Monument . 
 A small monument to the Battle of Sullivan 's Island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island , overlooking the inlet where General Clinton 's soldiers had hoped to cross . The monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement . 
 One iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by Colonel <unk> . Commissioned by the colonial government , he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner , which was flown at the fort during the battle . Despite being shot down during the siege , it was seen as a symbol of this successful defense ( and famously raised during victory ) . It came to be known as the <unk> flag or Liberty Flag . When Charleston ( lost to the British in the <unk> siege ) was reclaimed by American forces at the end of the war , the flag was returned to the city by General <unk> Greene .

 Hu <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; c . <unk> – 1674 ) was a Chinese artist , <unk> and publisher . He worked in calligraphy , traditional Chinese painting , and seal @-@ carving , but was primarily a publisher , producing academic texts as well as records of his own work . 
 Hu lived in <unk> during the transition from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty . A Ming loyalist , he was offered a position at the rump court of the <unk> Emperor , but declined the post , and never held anything more than minor political office . He did , however , design the <unk> Emperor 's personal seal , and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor 's capture and death in 1645 . He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten <unk> Studio , in which he practised various multi @-@ colour printing and <unk> techniques , and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise . Hu 's work at the Ten <unk> Studio pioneered new techniques in colour <unk> , leading to delicate <unk> of colour which were not previously <unk> in this art form . 
 Hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled The Ten <unk> Studio Manual of Painting and <unk> , an artist 's <unk> which remained in print for around 200 years . His studio also published seal catalogues , academic and medical texts , books on poetry , and decorative writing papers . Many of these were edited and prefaced by Hu and his brothers . 
 
 = = Biography = = 
 
 Hu was born in <unk> County , Anhui Province in <unk> or early <unk> . Both his father and elder brother <unk> ( <unk> , art name <unk> , <unk> ) were <unk> , and after he turned 30 he travelled with them while they practised medicine in the areas around Lu 'an and <unk> . It is commonly stated that <unk> himself was also a doctor , though the earliest sources <unk> to this occur only in the second half of the 19th century . 
 By 1619 , Hu had moved to <unk> where he lived with his wife Wu . Their home on <unk> ( <unk> , now also known as <unk> <unk> ) , a hill located just within the northern city wall , served as a meeting @-@ house for like @-@ minded artists . Hu named it the Ten <unk> Studio ( <unk> , <unk> ) , after the ten bamboo plants that grew in front of the property . It functioned as the headquarters for his printing business , where he employed ten artisans including his two brothers <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> , art name <unk> , <unk> ) and his sons <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> , courtesy name <unk> ) . 
 During Hu 's lifetime , the Ming dynasty , which had ruled China for over 250 years , was overthrown and replaced by China 's last imperial dynasty , the Qing . Following the fall of the capital Beijing in 1644 , remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a Ming loyalist regime in <unk> with Zhu <unk> on the throne as the <unk> Emperor . Hu , who was noted for his seal @-@ carving and facility with seal script , created a seal for the new Emperor . The court offered him the position of <unk> for the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) as a reward , but he did not accept the role ( although he did accord himself the title of <unk> <unk> in some of his subsequent personal seals ) . 
 According to <unk> <unk> 's Lost History of the South ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , prior to the Qing invasion of <unk> Hu studied at the National University there , and whilst a student was employed by the Ministry of <unk> to record official <unk> ; he produced the Imperial Promotion of Minor Learning ( Qin Ban <unk> , <unk> ) and the Record of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> Ji , <unk> ) as part of this work . As a result , he was promoted to the Ministry of Personnel and gained <unk> to the <unk> Academy , but before he could take up this appointment , Beijing had fallen to the <unk> rebellion . Since contemporaneous biographies ( <unk> 's work was not published until 1830 ) make no mention of these events , it has been suggested that they were fabricated after Hu 's death . 
 Hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in 1646 , after the end of the Ming dynasty . <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> recorded visiting him during his later years , in 1667 and <unk> respectively . He died in poverty at the age of 90 , sometime around late <unk> or early 1674 . 
 
 = = Seal @-@ carving = = 
 
 Hu <unk> was a noted seal @-@ <unk> , producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries . His style was rooted in the classical seal script of the Han dynasty , and he followed the <unk> school of carving founded by his contemporary He <unk> . Hu 's calligraphy , although balanced and with a clear <unk> structure , is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed . <unk> seals attempt to <unk> an ancient , weathered impression , although unlike other <unk> artists Hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals . 
 Hu 's work was known outside his local area . Zhou <unk> , a poet who lived in <unk> around the same time as Hu and was a noted art <unk> , stated in his Biography of Seal @-@ <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) that Hu " creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure " , implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through <unk> . 
 In 1644 , Hu took it upon himself to create a new Imperial seal for the <unk> Emperor , which he carved after a period of <unk> and prayer . He presented his creation with an essay , the Great <unk> of the Seal ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , in which he <unk> the loss of the <unk> Emperor 's seal and <unk> Heaven 's favour in restoring it . Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming , equally @-@ footed couplets ( <unk> , <unk> ) used in the Imperial examinations , but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the Southern Ming court . 
 
 = = Ten <unk> Studio = = 
 
 Despite his reputation as an artist and seal @-@ <unk> , Hu was primarily a publisher . His publishing house , the Ten <unk> Studio , produced reference works on calligraphy , poetry and art ; medical textbooks ; books on etymology and <unk> ; and copies of as well as commentaries on the Confucian Classics . Unlike other publishers in the area , the Ten <unk> Studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels . This bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio 's location : the mountain on which Hu took up residence was just to the north of the <unk> <unk> ( National Academy ) , which provided a captive market for academic texts . Between 1627 and 1644 , the Ten <unk> Studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind , aimed at a wealthy , literary audience . The studio 's earliest publications were medical textbooks , the first of which , <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) was published in 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later . Hu 's brother <unk> was a medical <unk> and appears to have been the author of these books . 
 During the <unk> the Ten <unk> Studio also produced political works <unk> the rule of the Ming ; these included the Imperial Ming Record of <unk> ( Huang Ming <unk> Ji , <unk> ) , a biography of loyal Ming officials , and the <unk> of the Imperial Ming ( Huang Ming <unk> , <unk> ) , a list of Imperial <unk> . After the fall of the Ming Dynasty , Hu renamed the studio the Hall <unk> in the Past ( <unk> , <unk> ) as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty , although the Ten <unk> imprint continued to be used . Despite Hu 's withdrawal from society after 1646 , the studio continued to publish well into the Qing dynasty , for the most part <unk> on seal impression catalogues showcasing Hu 's carving work . 
 The Ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in China . At his studio , Hu <unk> experimented with various forms of <unk> printing , creating processes for producing multi @-@ coloured prints and <unk> printed designs . As a result , he was able to produce some of China 's first printed publications in colour , using a block printing technique known as " <unk> block printing " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) . This system made use of multiple blocks , each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour . It was a lengthy , <unk> process , requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy <unk> and impressions to create a single image . Hu also employed a related form of multiple @-@ block printing called " set @-@ block printing " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again . He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for <unk> some of the ink off the blocks before printing ; this enabled him to achieve <unk> and <unk> of shades which were not previously possible . 
 In some images , Hu employed a blind <unk> technique ( known as " <unk> designs " ( <unk> , <unk> ) or " <unk> blocks " ( <unk> , <unk> ) , using an <unk> , <unk> block to stamp designs onto paper . He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants . This was a relatively new process , having been invented by Hu 's contemporary Wu <unk> , who was also a <unk> @-@ based publisher . Wu had used this technique for the first time in his book Wisteria Studio <unk> Paper ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , published in <unk> . Both Hu and Wu used <unk> to create decorative writing papers , the sale of which provided a <unk> income for the Ten <unk> Studio . 
 
 = = Major works = = 
 
 Hu 's most notable work is the Ten <unk> Studio Manual of Painting and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , an anthology of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists ( including Hu himself ) , published in 1633 . It consists of eight sections , covering calligraphy , bamboo , flowers , rocks , birds and animals , plums , orchids and fruit . Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes . As well as a collection of artworks , it was also intended as an artistic <unk> , with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for <unk> to copy . Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo , the book still remains the first example of a <unk> and analytical approach to Chinese painting . In this book , Hu used his multiple @-@ block printing methods to obtain <unk> of colour in the images , rather than obvious outlines or overlaps . The manual is bound in the " butterfly binding " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) style , whereby whole @-@ <unk> illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double @-@ page spread . This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image . Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual , including all writings and illustrations in August , 2015 . Said Charles <unk> , Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department , " The binding is so fragile , and the manual so delicate , that until it was <unk> , we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it – despite its <unk> importance to scholars . " 
 This volume went on to influence colour printing across China , where it paved the way for the later but better @-@ known Manual of the <unk> <unk> Garden ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , and also in Japan , where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in <unk> @-@ e of the colour <unk> printing process known as <unk> @-@ e <unk> . The popularity of the Ten <unk> Studio Manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late Qing dynasty . 
 Hu also produced the work Ten <unk> Studio <unk> Paper ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , a collection of paper samples , which made use of the <unk> stamped <unk> technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief . Whilst primarily a catalogue of decorative writing papers , it also contained paintings of rocks , people , ritual vessels and other subjects . The book was bound in the " wrapped back " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) style , in which the <unk> pages are folded , stacked , and <unk> along the open edges . Originally published in 1644 , it was reissued in four volumes between 1934 and 1941 by <unk> <unk> and Lu <unk> , and revised and republished again in 1952 .

 Other works produced by Hu 's studio included a reprint of Zhou <unk> 's manual of seal @-@ script calligraphy , The Six <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) and the related <unk> Investigations into <unk> ( <unk> Bi Ji , <unk> ) , which discussed common errors in the formation of characters . With his brother <unk> , Hu edited a new introductory edition of the Confucian classics , entitled The <unk> Text of the Four Books , <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ( 1640 ) , giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text . A similar approach was taken with the <unk> of the Thousand Character Classic in Six <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ( 1663 ) , which Hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher , Li <unk> . It was published after Li 's death , partly in homage to him . 
 The three Hu brothers worked together to <unk> a student <unk> on poetry by their contemporary <unk> <unk> , which was called simply the <unk> of Poetry ( Shi Tan , <unk> ) ( <unk> ) . Other works on poetry from the studio included <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of Selected Tang Poems ( <unk> Tang Shi <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included <unk> by Hu <unk> himself . 
 Among the studio 's more obscure publications was a text on Chinese <unk> entitled <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , written under a pseudonym but with a preface by Hu <unk> .

 = Raid on Manila ( 1798 ) = 
 
 The Raid on Manila of January 1798 was a Royal Navy false flag military operation during the French Revolutionary Wars intended to scout the strength of the defences of Manila , capital of the Spanish Philippines , capture a Manila galleon and assess the condition of the Spanish Navy squadron maintained in the port . Spain had transformed from an ally of Great Britain in the War of the First Coalition into an enemy in 1796 . Thus the presence of a powerful Spanish squadron at Manila posed a threat to the China Fleet , an annual convoy of East <unk> merchant ships from <unk> in Qing Dynasty China to Britain , which was of vital economic importance to Britain . So severe was this threat that a major invasion of the Spanish Philippines had been planned from British India during 1797 , but had been called off following the Treaty of <unk> <unk> in Europe and the possibility of a major war in India between the British East India Company and the Kingdom of Mysore . 
 To ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at <unk> in the winter of 1797 – 98 , the British commander in the East Indies , Rear @-@ Admiral Peter <unk> , sent a convoy to China escorted by the frigates HMS <unk> and HMS Fox and commanded by Captain Edward Cooke . After completing his mission Cooke decided to investigate the state of readiness of Spanish forces in Manila himself . He was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from Manila , which would make a valuable prize . <unk> in <unk> and accompanied by Captain Pulteney Malcolm in Fox , Cooke reached the Spanish capital on 13 January 1798 . 
 <unk> in Manila Bay , Cooke pretended that his ships were French vessels and successfully lured successive <unk> of Spanish officials aboard , taking them prisoner in turn . Once he had determined from his captives the state of defences in Manila , that the treasure ship had been <unk> at <unk> and that the Spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations , he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats in the mouth of the <unk> River . <unk> the gunboats in a bloodless attack , Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards , unsuccessfully assaulting <unk> before returning to <unk> . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 In 1796 , after three years of the French Revolutionary Wars , Spain and the French Republic signed the Treaty of San <unk> . The secret terms of this treaty required Spain to renounce its alliance with Great Britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally . In the East Indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant British forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the Spanish Philippines to the east . Britain dominated the East Indies in 1796 , controlling the trade routes through the Indian Ocean from the ports of Bombay , Madras and Calcutta . Dutch Ceylon , the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies had been captured in 1795 , and the French presence in the region had been confined to Île de France and a few subsidiary islands in the Western Indian Ocean . 
 Some of the most important trade routes began at <unk> and <unk> in Qing Dynasty China . Early in each year a large convoy known as the " China Fleet " , composed of large East <unk> merchant ships in the employ of the British East India Company , sailed <unk> to Europe from <unk> laden with tea and other commercial cargo . This convoy was economically significant to Britain : one convoy in 1804 was valued at over £ 8 million ( the equivalent of £ 600 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) . In January 1797 the convoy had been attacked by the French squadron in the East Indies , comprising six frigates commanded by <unk> @-@ <unk> Pierre César Charles de <unk> . In the ensuing <unk> Strait Incident the commander deceived <unk> into believing that the <unk> convoy contained disguised ships of the line and the French admiral retreated , only learning of his error on his return to Île de France . There was considerable concern in India that <unk> might try again in 1798 , or that the Spanish , who maintained a powerful squadron at <unk> , might make an attempt of their own . 
 <unk> 's initial impulse on learning in November 1796 of the impending declaration of war between Britain and Spain was to draw up plans for a major invasion of the Philippines , centred on Manila in repetition of the successful British capture of Manila in <unk> . Co @-@ operating with the Governor @-@ General of India Sir John Shore and Colonel Arthur <unk> among others , a substantial naval and military forces were earmarked for the operation which was in the advance planning stages , when unexpected news arrived in India in August 1797 announcing the Treaty of <unk> <unk> which brought the War of the First Coalition to an end . Britain now faced France and Spain alone , while <unk> from the Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore , an old opponent of Britain in Southern India , were seeking French assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities . The resources planned for the operation against Manila were therefore retained in India and the operation cancelled , but the protection of the China Fleet was still essential and <unk> diverted some of his squadron eastwards to China . 
 A number of merchant ships had gathered at Bombay in the spring of 1797 in preparation for the trip to <unk> to load trade goods and join the China Fleet . To escort this force , <unk> provided the 40 @-@ gun frigate HMS <unk> , captured from the French at the Battle of <unk> in 1794 , and the 50 @-@ gun HMS Centurion , which sailed with the convoy in July , taking passage through the Straits of <unk> , joined there by the ships of the line HMS <unk> and HMS <unk> and the 32 @-@ gun frigate HMS Fox under Captain Pulteney Malcolm for the final voyage to <unk> . The convoy arrived without incident on 13 December 1797 , although the crews had been substantially weakened by tropical illnesses .

 With his convoy safely at anchor in <unk> and the China Fleet several weeks from sailing , Cooke decided to reconnoitre Manila and make observations on the port and the Spanish squadron based there . As an added motivation , rumours in <unk> suggested that the annual Manila galleon was due to arrive . This ship brought up to two million Spanish silver dollars from Acapulco across the Pacific Ocean stopping at Guam on its way to Manila . <unk> its dollars in the Philippines , the ship then loaded trade goods from the East Indies for the return journey to New Spain . This round trip was essential to the maintenance of the Spanish Empire in the East Indies , which operated at an enormous financial loss only <unk> by the substantial subsidy from New Spain . Spanish dollars were the accepted currency across most of the East Indies , and disruption of this financial system could have profound effects on regional trade ; but British sailors had nevertheless been attacking the Manila <unk> since Thomas <unk> in <unk> . 
 Leaving the heavier warships at <unk> , Cooke sailed on 5 January 1798 only with <unk> and Fox , the latter carrying a Mr. Bernard , an experienced linguist . Passing Luzon , Cooke 's ships encountered a small Spanish merchant vessel , which was lured towards the frigates , which were flying French <unk> . <unk> the Spanish vessel , Cooke closely questioned the captain and learned that most of the Spanish squadron in Manila were undergoing extensive repairs at <unk> and were unfit to sail . Cooke rewarded the captain by releasing his vessel with its cargo intact , although he did remove 3 @,@ 900 silver dollars . The Spanish squadron had suffered badly in a typhoon in April 1797 and much of the damage had still not been repaired by the time Cooke 's small squadron arrived off Manila . Cooke had taken precautions to disguise his ships as French vessels , modelling <unk> on the powerful 40 @-@ gun Forte and Fox on the smaller <unk> .

 Late in the afternoon of 13 January 1798 , <unk> and Fox arrived in Manila Bay , slipping <unk> past the fortress of <unk> and then sailing across the bay on the morning of 14 January , anchoring between Manila and <unk> . From his <unk> point Cooke could see the Spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in <unk> , the ships of the line San Pedro , Europa and <unk> and the frigates Maria de la <unk> and <unk> in dock and unfit for action . To Cooke 's disappointment he could also see the Manila galleon , <unk> being <unk> at the <unk> docks and another valuable merchant ship Rey Carlos aground in the harbour . The Spanish had learned only shortly before Cooke 's arrival that the British frigate HMS Resistance under Captain Edward <unk> was in Philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack . 
 Fox was the first British ship into the anchorage , and was consequently approached by the <unk> , whose crew came aboard . Malcolm , like Cooke , spoke French <unk> and with Bernard translating was able to persuade the officer in charge that the new <unk> were Forte and <unk> seeking supplies and Spanish reinforcements for commerce raiding operations . The officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of the Spanish ships would be in a position to sail until March at the earliest . Cooke then joined the party on the deck of Fox , claiming to be Commodore <unk> , a French officer who , unknown to the Spanish , had been killed in the Action of 9 September 1796 off Sumatra . The Spanish officer was now completely convinced by the <unk> , which had been augmented by fake French uniforms . <unk> the visitor below decks , Cooke then passed wine around and together they drank a series of <unk> , including " the downfall of England " . 
 For an hour the officers drank , Malcolm and Cooke learning detailed information about the state of the defences and squadron in the Philippines , until a second boat pulled alongside Fox containing more officers keen to <unk> the French <unk> . This vessel was the personal barge of the Spanish commander at <unk> , Rear @-@ Admiral Don <unk> María de <unk> , who was not aboard , but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat . Each time , the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at <unk> and taken below decks as prisoners of war . In Malcolm 's cabin , the captured officers were informed of their situation , promised release before the British frigates sailed , and offered more wine . The crew of Fox meanwhile forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and <unk> their clothing . <unk> into the Spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby <unk> River , where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored . Taking the crews by surprise , the British boarding parties drove off the Spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside Fox . These vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well @-@ armed , one with a 32 @-@ pounder long gun and two with 24 @-@ pounder long guns , each supplemented by four <unk> guns . 
 The harbour captain reached Fox shortly afterwards , furious at the seizure of the gunboats and demanding they be returned . Malcolm received him with a <unk> of near incomprehensible French and brought him to join the other captured officers in his cabin , while the boat 's crew were imprisoned below decks . Shortly afterwards , at 16 : 00 , Cooke and Malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer captives and sent food and <unk> to the crew , the total number of Spanish sailors on Fox now numbering approximately 200 . Once the meal was finished , Cooke allowed all of the captives to return to their boats and row for shore without the conditions of parole , although he retained the captured gunboats . 
 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 
 Cooke led his small squadron past <unk> on 15 January and turned south . Four days later in a storm one of the gunboats broke its tow line and was never seen again , lost with its twelve crew . The frigates subsequently scouted <unk> before reaching <unk> on 22 January . There Cooke raised Spanish colours in an attempt to <unk> the authorities into supplying food and water to his squadron but <unk> grounded on a <unk> at the entrance to the port which raised the suspicions of a <unk> sent by the governor of <unk> , <unk> <unk> . The captain of the Spanish boat asked the British ships the names of their captains , and on receiving no answer but a volley of rifle fire , he put the town on alert . With the defenders <unk> , Cooke abandoned his <unk> and after <unk> <unk> the following morning , ordered a bombardment of the fort protecting the harbour . This had little effect , though later the Spanish recovered at least 450 <unk> from different <unk> , and Malcolm then attempted an amphibious landing in order to storm the <unk> side of the fort . The boats came under heavy fire , one smashed by a <unk> , killing two and wounding four . Another boat grounded on a <unk> and became stuck ; so with his force in <unk> , as 250 villagers armed with lances ambushed and drove the British from the beach , Malcolm called off the operation . After exchanging shot for an hour both frigates cut their anchor cables and retreated out of range , with two dead and one wounded on <unk> and eight wounded on Fox , in addition to those lost in the boats . The defenders lost a single man killed and 4 wounded . 
 With his frigates now requiring repairs , Cooke withdraw half a league from <unk> and spent three days <unk> the masts and rigging of the ships . Then he sailed north , scuttling the two remaining gunboats as he did not believe they would survive the return journey to <unk> . Four days later , on 27 January the squadron halted at a village named " <unk> " in the north of the Sultanate of <unk> to collect fresh water . On the beach a boat party from <unk> was set upon by <unk> tribesmen . Two were killed and nine others taken captive and dragged into the forest before rescuers could arrive . Cooke complained to Sultan <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> and the captured sailors were eventually recovered , although not before <unk> and Fox had sailed for China to escort the merchant convoy back to India . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 Cooke 's opportunistic diversion had determined that the Spanish forces in the Philippines posed no immediate threat , although the mission had cost 18 lives : Admiral <unk> later expressed his satisfaction with the outcome in a letter to the Admiralty . More might have been achieved with reinforcements : Historian C. <unk> Parkinson suggests that had Cooke 's squadron united with Resistance together they may have been able to destroy the disarmed Spanish warships at <unk> . He also notes however that in this scenario <unk> would have been commanding officer , a man with considerably less imagination and <unk> than Cooke . Historian Richard <unk> was critical of the mission , considering the operation to have " no glorious outcome " and citing the failure to capture the treasure ships as its greatest short @-@ coming . 
 The 1798 China Fleet sailed without further incident . During the ensuing year Resistance was destroyed by an accidental explosion in July in the <unk> Strait , and the majority of <unk> 's forces were focused on disrupting the French occupation of Suez in the Red Sea . This diversion of British resources created gaps in the coverage in merchant shipping and <unk> was able to send the frigate <unk> and <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> to Manila late in the year to join the repaired Spanish squadron . At the beginning of February <unk> , this combined force sailed to <unk> , taking the British defences by surprise . The British commander Captain William <unk> <unk> , advancing on the Franco @-@ Spanish force which retreated during the day and disappeared under cover of darkness that evening in the <unk> Archipelago . The combined squadron then dispersed and the China Fleet was not attacked again until the Battle of <unk> <unk> in 1804 , at which a French squadron was again driven off in confusion . The frigates Cooke had mimicked , Forte and <unk> were sent to operate independently against British trade in the Indian Ocean in early <unk> . <unk> was captured by HMS <unk> at the Action of 9 February <unk> near Southern Africa , and Forte was intercepted by HMS <unk> under Cooke on 28 February near <unk> in Bengal . In the ensuing battle Forte was captured but Cooke mortally wounded , dying on 25 May .

 B of the Bang was a sculpture by Thomas <unk> next to the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester , England , which was commissioned to mark the 2002 Commonwealth Games ; it was one of the tallest structures in Manchester and the tallest sculpture in the UK until the completion of <unk> in 2008 . It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the <unk> Tower of <unk> . The sculpture took its name from a quotation of British <unk> <unk> Christie , in which he said that he started his races not merely at the " <unk> " of the starting pistol , but at " the B of the Bang " . 
 The sculpture was commissioned in 2003 ; construction overran and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005 . Six days before the launch , the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems as the tip of one of the spikes detached and fell to the ground . Legal action started a year later , resulting in an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement totalling £ 1 @.@ 7 million . 
 In February 2009 , Manchester City Council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed in storage . Despite the promise of storage and potential <unk> , the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal . The core was sold for scrap in July 2012 , while the 180 spikes remain in storage .

 B of the Bang originally stood 56 metres ( 184 ft ) tall with 180 hollow tapered steel columns or spikes radiating from a central core . It was angled at 30 degrees and supported by five 25 m ( 82 ft ) long , tapered steel legs which connected to the spikes 22 m ( 72 ft ) above the ground . The sculpture weighed 165 tonnes , with the concrete in the foundations weighing over 1 @,@ 000 tonnes , including a 400 m2 ( 4 @,@ 300 sq ft ) reinforced concrete slab . The foundations are 20 m ( 66 ft ) deep . 
 The sculpture was made from the same <unk> steel ( also known as <unk> @-@ Ten ) as the Angel of the North sculpture , which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements . This layer inhibits further corrosion by reducing its <unk> to water . As part of the design , the spikes <unk> slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts in excess of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . At the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture , containing children 's poems and paintings , due to be opened circa 2300 . The location of the time capsule after <unk> is currently unknown . 
 B of the Bang was located next to the City of Manchester Stadium at <unk> , in <unk> , at the corner of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road ; . It took its name from a quotation of British <unk> <unk> Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the ' <unk> ' of the starting pistol , but at ' The B of the Bang ' . The artwork had been nicknamed <unk> by the locals after the popular children 's game from the 1970s . 
 Prior to the construction of <unk> at the University of Nottingham , B of the Bang was Britain 's tallest sculpture at well over twice the height of the Angel of the North , which stands at 66 feet ( 20 m ) . It was designed to look like an exploding <unk> and was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the <unk> Tower of <unk> . It was commissioned by New East Manchester Limited to commemorate the 2002 Commonwealth Games . The design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in 2002 and was designed by Thomas <unk> .

 The sculpture was constructed in Sheffield by Thomas <unk> Studio , <unk> Lucas , Flint and <unk> and <unk> Structures . It was approved at the start of 2003 , with the central core arriving in Manchester on 13 June 2004 . This was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory , and required a police escort . This central core was lifted into place in August 2004 , after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached . Early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of July 2003 , which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname G of the Bang . 
 The official unveiling by <unk> Christie took place on 12 January 2005 . 
 In total the sculpture cost £ 1 @.@ 42 million to design and construct — twice the original estimate , as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs . Funding was sourced from a European Regional Development Fund contribution of £ 700 @,@ 000 , the North West Development Agency , contributing £ 500 @,@ 000 , and Manchester City Council providing £ 120 @,@ 000 .

 The tip of one of the 2 @.@ 1 m ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on 6 January 2005 , only six days before the official unveiling . After inspection , the event went ahead as planned . 
 Four months later , in May 2005 , a second spike had to be cut off by <unk> after it was discovered hanging loose . At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public , and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed . As a result , some of the joints were re @-@ <unk> , with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement . This consisted of <unk> tip weights to 70 % of the spikes ' weights . 
 Despite these modifications , B of the Bang remained <unk> off , prompting a local newspaper campaign to ' Get It <unk> ' . In May 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for <unk> analysis , to discover the stresses being placed on the steel . 
 It was announced in October 2007 that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture , with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture . In November 2008 this culminated in an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council , the project 's designers Thomas <unk> Studio Ltd , and the engineering and construction <unk> <unk> Lucas Ltd , Flint and <unk> Partnership and <unk> Structures Ltd . The agreement was to pay the council £ <unk> in damages for breach of contract and negligence .

 Acting on a report in January 2009 , the city council recommended that B of the Bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe <unk> . The report recognised the sculpture 's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long @-@ term solution . One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with <unk> made from carbon fibre , although the report <unk> the necessity for extensive testing . 
 In January 2009 , Antony <unk> , creator of the Angel of the North — to which B of the Bang is often compared — spoke out in support of the sculpture , stating that , " It is a great tribute to Manchester that this ground @-@ breaking work was commissioned . To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council 's <unk> . " 
 Despite <unk> 's plea , removal of B of the Bang began in April 2009 . More substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm <unk> Brothers Limited began removing the spikes with <unk> cutting equipment . 
 Although the council had promised to store the complex central core and legs , these too were cut apart during removal , casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture 's return , and in early July 2012 the core was sold as scrap for £ 17 @,@ 000 . 
 
 
 = Battle of the <unk> River = 
 
 The Battle of the <unk> River took place during the Second World War and involved Australian , New Zealand and Japanese forces . Part of the wider <unk> Campaign of the Pacific theatre , the battle was fought in the southern sector of <unk> Island . Coming after the Battle of <unk> 's Knoll in which a strong Japanese counterattack was defeated , the battle occurred in two distinct periods between 17 April and 22 May 1945 , as elements of the Australian 15th Brigade advanced south along the <unk> Road . 
 The initial phase saw the Australians advance towards the <unk> River . Following the end of the early fighting , the Australian advance towards the main Japanese concentration at <unk> continued as they struck out towards the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . This continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective , <unk> away many bridges and roads upon which the Australians relied for supplies . As the Australian advance stalled , the Japanese began harassing the Australian line of communications , and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late @-@ July and into August , the Australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards <unk> again . Ultimately , though , the war came to an end before the final Australian advance began , bringing the campaign to an end .

 Japanese forces had landed on <unk> in early 1942 , capturing it from the small force of Australians <unk> the island . They had subsequently developed several <unk> on the island , using it to conduct operations in the northern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the United States , Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area . These bases also helped protect Rabaul , the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea , and throughout 1943 , Allied planners determined that <unk> was vital for <unk> the Japanese base around Rabaul . 
 US Marines conducted an amphibious landing at Cape <unk> , on the western coast of the island , north of Empress Augusta Bay , in November 1943 . After an initial counter @-@ attack , the US Marines had been replaced by a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around <unk> , establishing a strong perimeter . In March 1944 , the Japanese launched a heavy counter @-@ attack , which was turned back with heavy casualties . After this , the situation on <unk> became largely static , as the Japanese focused primarily on subsistence , and the US forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around <unk> . 
 In late 1944 , as part of plans to free US troops up for the Philippines campaign , the Australian II Corps — consisting of mainly Militia troops under the command of Lieutenant General Stanley <unk> — took over responsibility for Allied operations on <unk> from the American XIV Corps . Australian forces began arriving on the island between November and December 1944 , initially establishing themselves around the US base at <unk> . Due to inaccurate intelligence , <unk> mistakenly believed that the Japanese forces on the island numbered just 17 @,@ 500 men , and he consequently decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from <unk> in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere , rather than maintaining the defensive posture the US forces had adopted . However , Allied estimates of Japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of Japanese on the island at this time was closer to 40 @,@ 000 . 
 The campaign that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives : in the north , it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow <unk> Peninsula and contained ; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east – west avenues of approach , as well as <unk> them protection against further counter @-@ attacks , while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast ; and the main campaign in the south , where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated around <unk> . 
 
 = = = Preliminary moves = = = 
 
 Following the capture of Pearl Ridge in December 1944 , the Australian 7th Brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards <unk> . In late March and early April 1945 , they had fought the Battle of <unk> 's Knoll after which a brief lull followed as the Australians paused to shorten their supply lines . Meanwhile , the survivors of the Japanese force , heavily demoralised by their defeat , withdrew towards the <unk> River . The Australian 3rd Division was then ordered to resume its advance south , being tasked with capturing the <unk> River , while the <unk> was also included as an " intermediate objective " . Japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the Australians at about 10 @,@ 500 men , of which 2 @,@ 300 were believed to be directly opposing the 3rd Division . The 15th Brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the Australian units on <unk> at the time and was moved up to relieve the 7th Brigade , which was in need of rest . 
 Under the command of Brigadier <unk> <unk> the 15th Brigade consisted of three infantry battalions as well as two troops of tanks from the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , engineers from the 15th Field Company , a battery of 155 @-@ mm guns from ' U ' Heavy Battery , field artillery from the 2nd Field Regiment , and a number of smaller support units . The <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion took over responsibility for <unk> 's Knoll replacing the 25th Infantry Battalion while the 24th Infantry Battalion took up a position across the <unk> Road . The brigade 's third battalion — the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion — did not join them until the beginning of May , and so the 7th Brigade 's 9th Infantry Battalion continued patrolling operations north of the <unk> River , in the <unk> area , until the 57th / 60th could dispatch elements to relieve them . Further inland , the 2 / 8th Commando Squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south @-@ east , defending the brigade 's left , or eastern , flank . 
 The Japanese forces opposing the Australians belonged to the 6th Division , under the command of Lieutenant General <unk> <unk> . <unk> had been ordered to delay the Australian advance between the <unk> and the <unk> for as long as possible , and with these orders in mind he had installed a number of strong points along the Australian 's expected line of advance . The division 's infantry had suffered heavily in the previous battle around <unk> 's Knoll and as a consequence , several units had to be reorganized or amalgamated . The front line positions were assigned to the 6th Field Artillery Regiment , while the 13th Infantry Regiment was to hold five <unk> to their rear along and <unk> the <unk> Road , designated ' A ' through to ' E ' . The 6th Field and 4th Field Heavy Artillery Regiments both held <unk> further back , designated ' F ' and ' G ' . The 23rd Infantry Regiment was placed in the rear , where it was being reconstituted following losses suffered during the attack on <unk> 's Knoll .

 The 15th Brigade took over the forward positions from the 7th Brigade on 17 April . Initial <unk> had the 24th Infantry Battalion on the <unk> Road around <unk> Creek , with the <unk> / 59th around <unk> , north @-@ east of <unk> 's Knoll , and the 57th / 60th , when it arrived to relieve the 9th , would be positioned further east <unk> a secondary , parallel track known to the Australians as the Commando Road . Two days later , <unk> received the order to commence the advance towards the <unk> from <unk> , who offered him the support of the 29th Brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden counter @-@ attack . In a change to the tactics that the Australians had previously employed prior to the fighting around <unk> 's Knoll , from early May they advanced on a two @-@ battalion front , instead of one . The 24th Infantry Battalion was in the van , moving along the <unk> Road with the <unk> / 59th protecting its flank and rear ; while 5 @,@ 000 yd ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) further inland the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion , commencing on 3 May , advanced along the Commando Road from <unk> , after taking over from the 9th Infantry Battalion . 
 Moving forward under a <unk> barrage as they moved beyond <unk> , the 24th Infantry Battalion was the first to contact the Japanese , carrying out an attack against Japanese positions around <unk> 's Creek on 17 April . <unk> by a troop of Matilda tanks from the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , an artillery barrage which fired over 700 shells , two infantry companies — ' C ' and ' D ' — from the 24th attacked the position while another — ' A ' Company — carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards <unk> and <unk> . The left forward company — ' D ' Company — reached its objective without trouble ; however , ' C ' Company — on the right along with the troop of tanks — came up against stiff Japanese resistance and became bogged down . ' A ' Company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the <unk> track . In support of ' A ' Company , <unk> came forward and raked the jungle , hacking through the <unk> to reveal several Japanese <unk> , which were destroyed by the Australian armour . As night fell , ' C ' Company dug in before resuming the attack the next morning . Engineers were brought forward , as was a <unk> , and the gap was <unk> . <unk> heavy fighting , the Australians forced their way across the creek . By the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of exploitation 400 yd ( 370 m ) beyond the creek , 37 Japanese had been killed for the loss of seven Australians killed and 19 wounded . After this , the Australians continued their advance towards <unk> Creek , which was a further 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the southeast . In response , the Japanese launched a number of determined counterattacks over the course of the following week , although these were turned back . During this time , the Australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements , one of which managed to slip through the Japanese defensive positions either side of the <unk> Road and carried out a reconnaissance of the <unk> River about 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 910 m ) south of the main crossing . Further patrols were carried out , as well as a number of ambushes , before the advance was resumed on 26 April . 
 <unk> their advance , the Australians were supported by three squadrons of <unk> from the Royal New Zealand Air Force — Nos. 14 , 22 and 26 Squadrons — which bombed and <unk> the ground in front of the advancing infantry , as well as a <unk> barrage of artillery and mortar fire . With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the <unk> , for just one man wounded . Further progress was made over the next week , but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices . After this , the 15th Brigade 's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines . The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also . To <unk> the effectiveness of the Australian tanks , the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support . Additionally , the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire . 
 Meanwhile , the previous day , 3 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion had begun operating along the parallel Commando Road to the north . Here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling , which resulted in them being ambushed . They also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching , and crossing the river , arriving there on 6 May . On 5 May , along the <unk> Road , the 24th Infantry Battalion had pressed forward again . <unk> with a tank troop in support , they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately 100 Japanese . After the lead Matilda 's machine gun jammed , the field gun opened fire on it , damaging it and wounding its crew . Moving around the stricken tank , the second Matilda , armed with a howitzer , opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the Japanese defenders from the position . That night , the Japanese artillery opened up on the Australian position with a heavy barrage , and the following morning put in a company @-@ sized counter @-@ attack . The fighting lasted for over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours , but when it was over the Australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack . In doing so , they suffered one killed and nine wounded , while the attacking Japanese had suffered heavily , losing 58 men killed . It was the biggest loss since the action at <unk> 's Knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the <unk> . 
 After this , the Australians were able to resume their advance to the river on 7 May without further opposition . The previous three weeks in which they had advanced 7 @,@ 000 yd ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) to the <unk> had been costly for them , however , with the Australian 24th Infantry Battalion losing 25 killed and 95 wounded . Against this , the Japanese had lost at least 169 killed . 
 
 = = = Crossing the <unk> = = = 
 
 Following the advance to the <unk> , there was a pause of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up , before attempting to cross the <unk> en <unk> . This allowed <unk> to re @-@ evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . As they waited for the advance to resume , the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time . As a part of these , the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the <unk> and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as <unk> 's Ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main Australian axis of advance . 
 The main crossing was planned for 20 May , with the <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion on the right tasked to cut the <unk> Road and the <unk> Track to the east of the river , while on the left the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion would divert the attention of the Japanese off the 24th Infantry Battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the Australian line , crossing at the <unk> <unk> , advancing straight up the <unk> Road . Preliminary moves began before this , and on 15 May a platoon from the 24th Infantry Battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on <unk> 's Ridge . After one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a Japanese field gun , they were forced to withdraw . Meanwhile , the <unk> <unk> squadrons — now reinforced by No. 16 Squadron — began an eight @-@ day aerial campaign , attacking along the length of the <unk> and Commando Roads . During this period , the New Zealanders flew 381 sorties , while artillery and mortars fired " thousands of rounds " . 
 Two days later , on 17 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion began its diversionary move on the left flank , crossing the <unk> inland and advancing along the Commando Road with 32 <unk> and two batteries of artillery in support . Crossing 500 yd ( 460 m ) north of the <unk> , the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing . Nevertheless , shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out , carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on 20 May . 
 In the centre , the main attack along the <unk> Road began at 08 : 30 on 20 May after 20 minutes of <unk> by New Zealand <unk> had prepared the ground . <unk> under a <unk> barrage , and with mortar and machine gun support , the 24th Infantry Battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve , along with two troops of Matilda tanks . <unk> the forward companies reached their objectives , but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig @-@ in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded . The attack was resumed the following day , and the Australians were able to advance to the <unk> <unk> ; however , they were prevented from moving any further as the Japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an Australian patrol encountered 70 Japanese and were forced to go to ground . Finally , a company from the 24th Infantry Battalion was able to move on to the high ground on <unk> 's Ridge , which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped . Engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature . 
 On the right flank , the <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the <unk> by <unk> . Beginning their move two days earlier , a number of patrols had had contacts with the Japanese . Meanwhile , using <unk> to drag the tanks through the mud , the Australian armour had crossed the river also and by 16 : 00 on 20 May the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river , <unk> to the Japanese . The following day , the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective , which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing , and further delayed by stiff resistance . Later , after one of the battalion 's patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and attacked a Japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned , leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount of ammunition . 
 By 22 May , although there were still a number of Japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications , most of the Australian objectives had been secured and <unk> up operations began . The last remaining defensive location before the <unk> was <unk> 's Ridge , where the Japanese were sheltering in tunnels . A heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge . It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry . Within a short period of time the <unk> Road was subsequently opened , providing the Australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign , being the advance to the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> Rivers . The final phase of the battle cost the Japanese 106 killed , while the Australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 During the course of the fighting around the <unk> , the Australians lost 38 men killed and 159 wounded , while the Japanese lost at least 275 men killed . Following the battle , the Australians continued their advance towards <unk> at the southern end of the island . Throughout the remainder of the month and into June , the 15th Brigade advanced along the <unk> Road , crossing the <unk> on 10 June . Beyond the river , the Japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply , and they consequently occupied a series of deep <unk> . These were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery , and the 15th Brigade subsequently crossed <unk> River before being relieved by Brigadier Noel Simpson 's 29th Brigade in early July . 
 As the 29th Brigade advanced toward the <unk> River , torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt . The height of the river rose 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . The <unk> Road was reduced , in the words of Gavin Long , " to a sea of mud " and many of the bridges upon which the Australian supply system was dependent were washed away . This rendered large @-@ scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the Australians even ceased patrolling operations across the <unk> ; meanwhile , the Japanese continued to harass the Australians , probing their positions and setting mines and traps , targeting the Australian line of communications . On 9 July , the 15th Infantry Battalion fought off a series of attacks around <unk> , at the junction of the <unk> River and the <unk> Road , which included a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment . Australian patrols were resumed in late July and continued into August . These attacks proved very costly , particularly amongst the Australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding . 
 Fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also , and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards <unk> continued into August , combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed . As a result , the final Australian operations on <unk> took place on the <unk> front in the northern sector , where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at <unk> <unk> had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the <unk> Peninsula . By mid @-@ August , however , following the dropping of two atomic bombs on <unk> and <unk> and Japan 's subsequent unconditional surrender , a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this , it spelt an end to major combat operations . 
 Following the end of the war , the Australian Army awarded three battle honours for the fighting around the <unk> River . The 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , and the 9th , 24th , 57th / 60th and <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalions received the battle honour " <unk> River " . A second battle honour — " <unk> 's Ridge – <unk> Ford " — was also awarded to the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , and the 24th and <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalions for the second stage of the fighting , while the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion received the separate battle honour of " Commando Road " for this period . 
 
 
 = Sonic the Hedgehog ( 1991 video game ) = 
 
 Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console . The game was first released in North America , Europe and Australia in June 1991 , and in Japan the following month . The game features an anthropomorphic <unk> named Sonic in a quest to defeat Dr. <unk> , a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical Chaos <unk> . Sonic the Hedgehog 's gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme , with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button . 
 The game 's development began in 1990 , when Sega ordered its <unk> development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the company . After considering a number of suggestions , the developers decided on a blue <unk> with spikes along his head and spine and renamed themselves " Sonic Team " to match their character . Sonic the Hedgehog , designed for fast gameplay , was influenced by the games of Super Mario series creator , Shigeru Miyamoto . Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic 's sprite to roll along curved scenery , which originated in a tech demo created by the game 's programmer , <unk> <unk> . 
 The game was well received by critics , who praised its visuals , music , and speed of gameplay . The game was also commercially successful , establishing the Genesis as a key player in the 16 @-@ bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super <unk> console . It has been ported a number of times , and inspired several <unk> , a successful franchise , and adaptations by other media . 
 
 = = Plot = = 
 
 In an attempt to steal the six Chaos <unk> and <unk> their power , the game 's antagonist , Dr. Ivo <unk> , has trapped the animal inhabitants of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules . The player controls Sonic , who aims to halt <unk> 's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the <unk> himself . 
 If the player collects all the Chaos <unk> and completes the game , a reward ending sequence is shown . If all the <unk> are not collected , <unk> taunts the player while <unk> the Chaos <unk> instead . 
 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 
 Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D , side @-@ scrolling platformer , whose gameplay centers around Sonic 's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs , slopes , high falls , and loop @-@ the @-@ loops . The levels contain <unk> in the form of robots ( " <unk> " in the Western game manuals ) inside of which Dr. <unk> has trapped animals . Although destroying a robot frees the animal within , this is not required to complete the game . The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes , falling into <unk> pits , being crushed by moving walls or platforms , and drowning ( which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from <unk> ) . Sonic 's main attack is his spin , where he <unk> into a ball and <unk> rapidly ( damaging enemies and some obstacles ) . This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground . 
 <unk> around each level map are gold rings , and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life . <unk> are a layer of protection against <unk> ; if Sonic has at least one ring when he <unk> with an enemy ( or obstacle ) , he will survive . However , all his rings will be scattered ; they will <unk> and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again . If Sonic is hit without any rings , he loses a life . Although shields and temporary <unk> may be collected to provide additional protection , certain <unk> ( such as drowning , being crushed , falling down a <unk> pit or running out of time ) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection . 
 The game is divided into six zones ( Green Hill , <unk> , Spring Yard , Labyrinth , Star Light , and <unk> Brain ) , each with its own visual style and enemies . A player must navigate through each zone ( subdivided into three acts ) to progress . At the end of each zone 's third act , the player confronts Dr. <unk> ( who pilots a different vehicle each time ) in a boss fight . After the sixth zone , the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with <unk> . 
 The player begins with three lives ( power @-@ ups and rings add more ) , which are lost when Sonic <unk> with hazardous enemies ( or objects ) without rings , falls off @-@ screen or exceeds an act 's ten @-@ minute time limit . <unk> acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most @-@ recently activated post when he loses a life . If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life , the <unk> will reset to 0 : 00 when he returns to the <unk> . If all lives are lost at any point in the game , the game over screen will appear ( when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives , if they have any continues ) . 
 When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings , a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage ( a " Secret Zone " in the original Genesis manual ) . In each of six Special <unk> , Sonic <unk> off the <unk> and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack . Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found , their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a " goal block " ( which ends the level ) .

 In 1990 , Sega ordered its in @-@ house development studio , <unk> , to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company . This was a position already held by the character Alex <unk> , but he was considered similar to Mario and deemed unsatisfactory ; Sega president <unk> <unk> wanted a character as iconic as Mickey Mouse . Sega had competition from Nintendo and its mascot , Mario , in mind ; Nintendo was dominant at the time , particularly after the release of the successful Super Mario Bros. 3 , and Sega wanted a foothold in the industry . Although the company had some success with Genesis ports of its arcade titles , it knew this would not be enough . 
 <unk> developed ideas for characters , an engine , and gameplay mechanics . Development emphasized speed , so <unk> eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals , as well as fast creatures like <unk> and squirrels . One idea , a <unk> able to grasp objects with prehensile ears , showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware . The team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball , their idea for an attacking move . <unk> then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough , so they focused on two animals with spikes : <unk> and <unk> . The <unk> character , first proposed by <unk> <unk> , prevailed , although the <unk> would later become the basis for Mighty the <unk> ( who first appeared in 1993 's <unk> the Hedgehog ) . <unk> has admitted since that he created Sonic 's basic design by combining Felix the Cat 's head with Mickey Mouse 's body . 
 Sonic was originally <unk> @-@ colored , then a light shade of blue , but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the Sega logo . His shoes were colored red through the inspiration of Michael Jackson 's boots on the album cover for Bad and the outfit of Santa Claus , whom <unk> saw as the most " famous character in the world " . Sonic 's spikes were emphasized to make him look <unk> , and he was given the ability to spin while jumping ( so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button ) . The new character was originally named " Mr. <unk> " , but the eight @-@ member <unk> changed his name to " Sonic " and their studios to Sonic Team . <unk> proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band , giving him vampire fangs , and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna , but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple . Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a <unk> is and initially proposed a full @-@ scale recreation of the character , but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes . The antagonist ended up being named " Dr. <unk> " in Japan and " Dr. <unk> " in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega 's American and Japanese divisions .

 With a satisfying protagonist completed , Sega turned to esteemed programmer <unk> <unk> , who had impressed them through his work on <unk> Star and the Genesis port of <unk> ' n <unk> . The gameplay originated with a tech demo by <unk> , who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix . <unk> 's prototype was a platform game with a fast @-@ moving character rolling in a ball through a long , winding tube , and this concept was <unk> out with <unk> 's character designs and levels by designer <unk> <unk> . <unk> originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the United States by the outbreak of the Gulf War , but was <unk> in the project for nearly a year . His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design . The game 's color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist <unk> Suzuki , and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of California . 
 In designing the game mechanics , <unk> was inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto , whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier . <unk> the simplicity of Miyamoto 's mechanics in complex environments , <unk> decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping . He also wanted his creation to be more action @-@ oriented than the Mario series ; while playing Super Mario Bros. , he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly . Due to the need to demonstrate the Genesis ' technological prowess , the developing game underwent extensive testing and redesign , a process taking over six months . The developers ' efforts were rewarded ; according to <unk> <unk> , the game had the fastest @-@ ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that was considered impossible on the console . The team intended to add a two @-@ player mode displayed via split @-@ screen , but <unk> 's programming knowledge was insufficient to implement this feature . However , such a mode would later appear in sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ( 1992 ) , where the second player would control Sonic 's best friend Miles " <unk> " <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> worked 19 hours a day on the project for several months . 
 <unk> 's relationship with Sega of Japan was tenuous during this time ; he received little credit for his involvement in the game . He left the company shortly after the game 's release , although Sega of America hired him later . Before leaving , however , he defied Sega of Japan 's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background , identifiable only by looking at the game 's code .

 The music for Sonic the Hedgehog was composed and produced by Masato <unk> , bassist and lead songwriter of the J @-@ pop band Dreams Come True . The game uses <unk> Yamaha <unk> and <unk> programmable sound generators to produce a variety of <unk> sound effects and music . It was originally intended to have a sound test menu with animations of Sonic <unk> to the music of a " Sonic Band " of <unk> <unk> on guitar , Max Monkey on bass , <unk> <unk> on drums , and <unk> the Crocodile on keyboard . The playable <unk> became a recurring character in the series , also appearing in <unk> ' <unk> , Sonic Heroes , and Sonic Free <unk> . The development schedule scrapped the feature , and <unk> <unk> replaced the test with the " Se @-@ <unk> ! " chant used in TV commercials ( which reportedly used one @-@ eighth of the memory of the four @-@ <unk> cartridge ) . 
 On October 19 , 2011 , twenty years after the game 's release , a three @-@ disc compilation of music from Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released in Japan . The first disc features original tracks from both games , the second contains Masato <unk> 's demo recordings and the third comprises songs by Dreams Come True and their <unk> remixes .

 Game @-@ package illustrator Akira <unk> said that his goal was to make the characters " colorful " , using clear lines and <unk> to " finish them <unk> " . According to <unk> , the developers asked him to create a package design " similar to pop art ... without being particular to conventional packages " – something " original " and " stylish " . The game was released in North America , Europe , and Australia on June 23 , 1991 , and in Japan on July 26 . Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles , replacing <unk> Beast .

 Sonic the Hedgehog was critically praised at its release and in retrospective reviews , with an 86 @-@ percent approval rating at the review aggregator GameRankings based on nine reviews . The game rivaled the Mario series , particularly Super Mario World ( which was recently released for Genesis rival Super Nintendo Entertainment System ) . Paul Rand of Computer and Video Games compared the two in depth and characterized Sonic the Hedgehog as being faster , with brighter colors , and Super Mario World as having more " depth of play " . 
 Reviewers noted the game 's colorful , detailed graphics . Rand called its color scheme " lively , but never <unk> " , praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites , backgrounds , and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Genesis . Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds " eye @-@ popping " and " gorgeous " , which was echoed by Mean Machines . According to the <unk> ( Hartley , Patricia , and Kirk ) of Dragon , " The graphics and animation in Sonic the Hedgehog make this a serious contender for the best video game of the year " and <unk> called the animation " some of the <unk> and fastest ... ever seen " . The music and sound effects were also well received ; Dragon called them " great " , and <unk> " amazing " . Rand noted " <unk> of catchy tunes and <unk> " , calling some of the sound effects " absolutely brilliant " . Although Mean Machines called the songs " vaguely appealing " , the game 's sound effects were better appreciated . 
 Critics cited the fast gameplay , unprecedented in <unk> . GamePro 's Boogie Man noted its " lightning @-@ fast action " and , according to Electronic Gaming Monthly ( <unk> ) , " If you thought the Enterprise was quick , wait till you see Sonic at <unk> speed . " The game 's difficulty was disputed , described as " impossible " by Rand and " average " by <unk> . Rand said about the gameplay in general that it " plays like a dream " ; according to <unk> it would <unk> players for hours , and Boogie Man praised Sonic Team 's ability to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jumping . Although <unk> , Dragon , and Paul of Mean Machines praised the level design ( especially the hidden rooms ) , Paul found losing all of one 's rings frustrating . 
 Sonic the Hedgehog has maintained its popularity , appearing on lists of the greatest video games of all time . Frank <unk> of GameSpot described the game as " one of the best <unk> of all time " , noting that despite technical issues in the Game Boy Advance port " after all these years , the underlying graphics , audio , and gameplay still hold up " . Lucas M. Thomas of IGN agreed that it stood the test of time : " You 'll be impressed by the clarity and color that come through ... Few people realize how difficult it was to create Sonic 's graphics engine , which allowed for the incredible rate of speed the game 's known for . But the technical achievement impressed back in ' 91 , and still does so today . " Mega ranked the game its third @-@ favorite Genesis title , and in 2001 Game Informer called it the 24th @-@ greatest game of all time . Sonic the Hedgehog has been a commercial success ; the original Genesis version sold over 15 million copies by February 2009 , and the mobile version had eight million paid downloads by 2008 .

 Primarily because of its Genesis <unk> , Sonic the Hedgehog contributed to the console 's North American popularity . During October – December 1991 , the Genesis <unk> the Super <unk> by a two @-@ to @-@ one ratio , and at its January 1992 peak claimed 65 percent of the market for 16 @-@ bit consoles . Although Nintendo eventually again overtook Sega , this was the first time since December 1985 that the company did not lead the console market . 
 Sonic the Hedgehog added speed and momentum @-@ based physics to the standard platform formula . Set @-@ pieces and mechanics introduced by the game ( such as loops , springs , and acceleration pads ) have appeared in other games and become associated with the Sonic series . 
 A flood of " animal with attitude " <unk> , each featuring a cartoon mascot , were released after Sonic the Hedgehog : <unk> , Aero the <unk> @-@ Bat , James Pond 3 , <unk> Jim , Zero the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the Tasmanian Tiger , <unk> .

 The game 's success led Sega to develop an extensive media franchise .

Sonic has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters ( keeping Sonic and <unk> as <unk> ) , surviving the end of Sega console manufacturing after the <unk> . The series has ventured from <unk> to fighting , racing , role @-@ playing , and sports games , and has expanded into anime and manga , cartoons and comic books , novels , and toys .

Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) , Peter Bishop ( Joshua Jackson ) , and Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) , new members of the Fringe division , are called to investigate by division head Phillip <unk> ( Lance <unk> ) , believing the case to be part of " The Pattern " , a string of mysterious incidents . The woman is identified as having recently left a local <unk> , and Olivia finds evidence that points to a past serial murder case she and her former partner John Scott were not able to solve . Olivia explains to Peter that their murderer would <unk> his victims , young women , then make an <unk> along their face to extract a piece of brain material , killing the victim in the process . Walter takes both corpses back to his lab and determines that the woman had only been pregnant minutes before giving birth , her child having accelerated aging disease . Walter is reminded of having previously done work in this field , and remembers where he <unk> his car that contains the related files .

 Co @-@ creators J. J. Abrams , Alex <unk> and Roberto Orci , and executive producer Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode . Paul A. Edwards served as the director , his first such credit for the series . In developing Fringe , the co @-@ creators did not want to make the series too serialized , as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams ' television series <unk> . They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content , and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and <unk> : Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration . <unk> explained , " While we make sure that our episodes are self @-@ contained – have a beginning , a middle , and an end – the character stories can be serialized . They don 't have to resolve themselves over the course of one show . " " The Same Old Story " was Fringe 's first regular episode , and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured . 
 The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series ' different departments . For the scene in which they remove the victim 's <unk> , the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley 's head . Using plaster to make a prosthetic , they " drilled out the <unk> and <unk> [ ed ] it open and [ went ] through a series of molds . " Stanley stated that " it 's really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me , even though it 's very gruesome because the <unk> 's popping out . " The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a " <unk> gun " ; according to prop master Peter <unk> , this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people 's clothing for concealed weapons . VFX Supervisor Christopher <unk> explained that for the eye 's last vision , they used " a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location , " which they then used to " take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab . " 
 " The Same Old Story " featured guest appearances by actors Derek Cecil as Christopher <unk> and Mark <unk> as his father , Dr. Claus <unk> .

 " The Same Old Story " received mixed reviews from television critics . TV Squad writer Jane <unk> thought the episode seemed " all over the place " , and wasn 't sure what to think .

The A.V. Club critic Noel Murray gave the episode a C + , while Television Without Pity graded it with a B. 
 Josh Jackson of Paste Magazine disliked the " <unk> ex <unk> " aspects that " <unk> solved the puzzles of the first two episodes " , and also criticized perceived " plot <unk> " like how the serial murderer immediately began aging once interrupted from killing his last victim . Despite these flaws , Jackson said he would tune in next week because he would " rather have a show <unk> on the side of unbelievable than unremarkable , and I 'm interested to see if Abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve " . Erin Fox of TV Guide also liked " The Same Old Story " better than the pilot because she thought that it " had really cool special effects , awesome Walter @-@ <unk> , and actual chemistry forming between Olivia and Peter " , and " we also got to <unk> more into the connections between Walter , Nina Sharp , Massive Dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before Walter was <unk> " . 
 A UGO Networks columnist was concerned that the expensive pilot would be hard to translate into weekly episodes , but " after sitting down to watch Fringe 's second episode , " The Same Old Story " , my concerns have vanished .

 During a concert on May 24 , 2010 , in the Prague club , <unk> , Blythe was involved in an incident that resulted in the death of Daniel <unk> , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old attending fan . According to <unk> statements cited by the Czech online daily newspaper <unk> following Blythe 's arrest , Blythe was chanting " Come on up " between songs , which , the newspaper stated , may have been intended to invite applause from the audience and not a direct invitation to fans . The newspaper went on to report that the fan tried to climb onstage and was thrown by the singer from the stage , falling backwards directly on his head . According to the same paper , <unk> was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol , suffered serious brain trauma , fell into a coma , and died weeks later from his injuries . 
 A report about the concert at issue released on May 26 , 2010 by <unk> stated that " one of the things that was unexpected was the behavior of the singer Randall Blythe , who on a few occasions struck some fans in a relatively brutal way off the stage . " The article also contains pictures , one of them showing Blythe holding a fan down on the ground . Meanwhile , another report released two days after the concert by <unk> alleged that " Randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an <unk> fan , who has climbed the podium several times . The front @-@ man clearly showed that it is his territory , he struck the intruder down , punched him a couple of times and sent him through the air off the podium , without even stopping singing ( ! ) " On May 28 , 2010 , the report by <unk> stated that " some broken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not like anybody on the stage " , while <unk> stated that " the only negative thing about the concert was , to say it <unk> , <unk> approach of the band towards the stage @-@ divers ... when somebody tried to climb the stage , he was brutally swept down . " 
 Following Blythe 's arrest , Tomáš <unk> , a promoter of the concert , said that there was no fight between the fan and Blythe , and that " it was an unfortunate incident which happened during the concert when someone climbed onto the stage where he was not supposed to be . " According to the Lamb of God publicist Adrenaline PR , " [ the ] incident deals with a fan that three times during the concert jumped the <unk> and rushed Randy during the performance . It is alleged that the third time , security was not able to reach him and that Randy pushed him back into the audience where supposedly he fell and hit his head . " However , it was revealed during the trial that it was a different fan who previously got into contact with Blythe than <unk> . Guitarist Willie <unk> said , " I can 't recall that particular show , let alone a fan being beaten on the stage . I think I would 've noticed something like that considering the <unk> thing . " 
 According to Blythe 's attorney Martin <unk> , the police launched an investigation following the death of <unk> , about a month after the concert and following a coma . After interviewing several <unk> from the concert , the police asked the United States Department of Justice to take part in the investigation ; however , they refused to cooperate and , <unk> , did not notify anyone from Lamb of God or its management .

Nevertheless , an extraordinary appeal may be lodged by the defendant or the Supreme State Attorney , which would be heard by the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic in <unk> ; an extraordinary appeal may , however , rest only on issues of law and does not provide for full review of the case . After exhausting all of these <unk> , the defendant may also <unk> a petition to the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic . The petition may be based on allegation of violation of rights under the Czech Constitution and Charter of <unk> Rights and Basic <unk> .

 = = = Day 1 of the trial = = = 
 
 The trial started on February 4 , 2013 . Blythe testified that when he wanted to see the club before the concert , Lamb of God 's <unk> told him that the club was terrible and <unk> . According to Blythe , the <unk> went on , saying that the stage was small , there were too many people , and that it was rather dangerous . 
 Blythe , who is <unk> , took off his glasses before entering the stage , which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half @-@ blind . Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage . One of the fans , who was identified as Milan <unk> by Czech newspapers , and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings , managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security . Blythe testified that during the first attempt , <unk> rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving . The second time , he tried to put his arms around Blythe in an attempt to <unk> him . Blythe , who according to his own words perceived this as a danger , caught <unk> 's collar , pushed him on the ground , <unk> on him and repeatedly told him to stop . He then led the fan by his hair to the edge of the stage , where the fan jumped off . It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back . Blythe further said that he saw <unk> trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security . 
 Later , when another fan tried to climb the stage , Blythe thought that it was <unk> again . Blythe testified that he approached the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him , which it did not . <unk> <unk> , author of video which caught the previous incidents with <unk> , testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him . Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him <unk> up . Blythe insisted that he never saw <unk> nor came into contact with him . It was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about <unk> 's death . 
 Blythe further testified that he was not under the influence of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any drugs . Chris <unk> , Lamb of God 's drummer , testified that he had not seen anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe 's aggressiveness is only a stage act . According to <unk> , Blythe is a calm , moderate , and well @-@ read person . The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd , but not to encourage people to climb the stage . 
 Blythe also alleged that after learning about <unk> 's death , he had written a letter to the <unk> family , in which he offered help and a meeting in @-@ person . Daniel <unk> 's father , however , testified that the family has not been contacted by anyone from the band nor by the defense team . <unk> 's father confirmed that his son had been healthy up until the day of the incident . The <unk> family 's representative brought a claim for damages in the amount of <unk> 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( <unk> . US $ <unk> @,@ 000 ) . 
 
 = = = Day 2 of the trial = = = 
 
 <unk> , eight witnesses delivered their testimonies on February 5 , 2013 . Among them were friends of Daniel <unk> . <unk> and three friends had come to attend the concert from <unk> , a town in mountains some 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) northwest of Prague . They described <unk> as a huge fan of Lamb of God who had been able to secure an <unk> from a guitar player before the concert had started . 
 <unk> 's friend Jan <unk> testified that <unk> climbed the stage , and as he turned around towards the crowd he was pushed by Blythe off the stage . He said he was " 100 % sure Blythe pushed <unk> with both hands . " He further said that Blythe 's behavior <unk> from all the concerts he had attended in the past , commenting that Blythe was visibly furious . He further claimed that <unk> was not the first person to be chased off the stage by Blythe , with another fan being kicked , choked and receiving a punch from Blythe . <unk> corroborated Blythe 's testimony that Blythe asked " Are you okay ? " after <unk> fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply . However , as <unk> fell sick after the concert , they called him an ambulance . According to <unk> , the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it . 
 <unk> 's other friend <unk> <unk> testified that <unk> 's fall happened in a break between the end of concert and the encore . <unk> climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage . According to him , Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off . While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage , <unk> fell directly on the ground . According to <unk> , there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break . <unk> further testified that after the fall , <unk> went to sit on a bench , where he was <unk> a water bottle . <unk> began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a <unk> at the back of his head , they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion . <unk> said that he understood Blythe 's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage . 
 Another person to testify was Robert <unk> , who worked as a security guard the night of the incident . <unk> said that the <unk> was too close to the stage , but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage . He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured . He further said that the fan 's fall might have been helped by someone else , perhaps the singer , though he did not see it precisely . 
 Blythe 's defense team attacked differences between the testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court . Among other things , one of the witnesses originally alleged that <unk> and Blythe shook hands or that one of them offered hand to another on stage ; however , at the court hearing , he testified that there was no prior contact between them . Blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior . 
 
 = = = Day 3 of the trial = = = 
 
 Milan <unk> , the fan whom Blythe admitted to <unk> off the stage , testified on the third day of the trial . <unk> said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive ; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage . <unk> testified that Blythe knocked him down , <unk> on him and held him down for a moment , but Blythe definitely did not <unk> him . He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he ( <unk> ) was drunk and the way he acted , Blythe 's reaction was adequate . He commented that he grasped the fact that he was not wanted on stage . 
 Another witness who had attended the concert at the rear of the crowd testified that Blythe 's behavior was standard to metal concerts , saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception . She said that it was evident that Blythe did not want any fans on the stage . Neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of <unk> 's fall at the end of the concert . 
 The judge also read a sworn statement from <unk> 's former producer , who stated that she had not known about the incident . She was aware that an ambulance was called that evening , but learned about the reasons for that only later , during the police investigation . The court further heard that Lamb of God had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue , including that barriers should be placed 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) from the stage . <unk> Tomáš <unk> testified that although this was not the case , the band had not expressed any concerns to him either before or after the concert . 
 Randy Blythe was called again to the stand that day . The judge first alerted him that he had the right to remain silent and can deny answering his questions . The judge went again through the Blythe 's testimony and , with a view to the previous witness statements , asked Blythe whether he insists that it was Milan <unk> whom Blythe threw off the stage . Blythe responded by saying : " To the best of my knowledge , it was Milan <unk> who was coming up [ on stage ] every time . " 
 Also that day , expert medical witness <unk> <unk> took the stand . According to The Prague Post , <unk> testified that <unk> 's cause of death was pneumonia resulting from a blow to the <unk> . <unk> added that the " mortality rate from this kind of injury is around 40 percent , and that doctors couldn 't have done more to save the patient . " <unk> was initially taken to a nearby hospital less than a kilometer from the venue , where the initial diagnosis took place . Since this hospital did not have a specialized <unk> department , <unk> was transferred to another hospital after the diagnosis . There , <unk> underwent two operations , first to tend to the injury and second to reduce pressure on brain by removing some bone . 
 Finally , defense asked for <unk> as a key witness fell ill . The court decided to continue with the hearings the next day , after which the hearings would be <unk> until March 4 , 2013 , in order to hear the defense 's witness . Blythe committed to return when the trial resumed . 
 
 = = = Day 4 of the trial = = = 
 
 On February 7 , 2013 , only one witness took the stand before the hearing was <unk> . <unk> <unk> contacted the defense after reading about the trial in newspapers because he " didn 't like the description of the situation " by the previous witnesses . He said he did not think Blythe was aggressive that night , and that fans should realize any aggressive behavior displayed onstage is just part of the show . He also said that each time somebody got on the stage , Blythe demonstrated that they were not allowed there . <unk> testified that he saw how a fan tried to reach the stage three times and that as he was preparing to stage dive , somebody aided his fall from behind . He had not seen anybody fall directly on the ground . <unk> had trouble recalling details from the show , as he had visited multiple concerts on other dates in <unk> , and thus could not describe , among other things , the position of the <unk> . 
 
 = = = Day 5 of the trial = = = 
 
 The trial resumed on March 4 , 2013 with testimonies from expert witnesses in the fields of criminal psychology ( <unk> <unk> , appointed by the court ) and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , appointed by the defense ) . Blythe returned to attend the hearings in person , even though the presiding judge had told him that at this point they may be undertaken in his absence . The two expert witnesses agreed that Blythe is not aggressive ; nevertheless , he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress . The court further heard testimonies from two <unk> . One of them was a bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall . He testified that when by the exit , he saw two men taking a third man out of the building to fresh air . He said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage . The ambulance arrived 5 – 10 minutes later . 
 Another <unk> was a fan , <unk> <unk> , who testified that she saw Blythe <unk> <unk> , saying " [ h ] e climbed onto the stage , and when he tried to stand up , Blythe <unk> him . " According to her , the <unk> was strong enough for <unk> to fall behind the front row of the fans into a place where no fans were staying at the moment . She testified that <unk> fell backwards . Another <unk> of the concert who took the stand that day did not recall seeing any fall by the end of the concert . 
 
 = = = Day 6 of the trial = = = 
 
 A defense @-@ appointed expert witness in the field of <unk> testified on March 5 that <unk> could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward , he could not have sustained an injury to the back of his head . He further said that if <unk> fell over the first row of the fans , he must have been not only pushed , but must have jumped himself . The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony , claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time , as well as some of the <unk> testimonies , according to which <unk> fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall . The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points . 
 In his closing speech , the State Attorney asked the court to <unk> Blythe for 5 years , claiming that " even children in the kindergarten are aware that a fall from height may lead to an injury . " 
 A <unk> family representative said that based on the witness testimonies , the family did not believe that Blythe was solely responsible . He continued that he would not be <unk> the requested amount , as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered . He further added that Daniel had died on his father 's birthday , and his mother has consequently become a <unk> patient unable to work . 
 In his closing word , Blythe said that he did not wish to avoid any responsibility and that if he felt guilty he would have pleaded so . He further commented that in case of <unk> , measures would be undertaken to avoid anything similar from happening at Lamb of God concerts again . 
 
 = = = First instance verdict = = = 
 
 On March 5 , 2013 , the court delivered a verdict , according to which Blythe was not <unk> liable for <unk> 's death , even though he had the moral responsibility for it . Consequently , the court dismissed the damages claim and ordered the return of Blythe 's bail . 
 The court held that it was proven that Blythe had thrown <unk> off the stage . However , Blythe , due to his <unk> , could have mistaken <unk> for the other fan who had repeatedly gotten over the <unk> . According to the court , the largest part of the blame lies with the <unk> and security members . Judge <unk> further <unk> Blythe for not having met with the <unk> family . 
 The State Attorney announced that he would appeal the verdict . 
 
 = = = Appeals verdict = = = 
 
 The State Attorney 's appeal was heard by a panel of three judges of the Prague High Court , chaired by judge <unk> <unk> . The hearing took place in Blythe 's absence . Blythe 's <unk> was upheld by the panel on June 5 , 2013 . 
 The verdict may have been appealed by the Supreme State Attorney ( <unk> ) to the Supreme Court . As the appeal hasn 't been lodged by <unk> within two months of the delivery of written second instance verdict , it has become final . 
 In 2015 Blythe demanded ca <unk> 15 millions for damages but the Municipal Court for Prague 2 dismissed the suit . 
 
 = = Reaction = = 
 
 In reaction to the arrest and detention , a fan created a petition at the official White House petition site . By the time Blythe was released on bail , it gathered over 27 @,@ 500 signatures . 
 On July 7 , 2012 , there was a vigil organized in Lamb of God 's hometown of Richmond , Virginia , by a friend of Blythe 's . At the event , <unk> ( who are also from Richmond ) frontman Dave <unk> said : “ I don ’ t think it was right for him to be arrested . I don ’ t think it was right for him to be locked up .... This stuff could have all been worked out <unk> or legally before he got there . ” In addition to <unk> , other notable figures in heavy metal , such as Tom Araya and David <unk> , have also come out in support of Blythe . 
 In a post to his blog , Blythe explained that he met the <unk> family in private after the trial , and promised them to be " a spokesperson for safer shows " . He emphasized that the family never attacked him and " just wanted to know the truth of what had happened to their son " . 
 
 
 = U.S. Route 2 in Michigan = 
 
 US Highway 2 ( US 2 ) is a component of the United States <unk> Highway System that connects Everett , Washington , to the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) of the US state of Michigan , with a separate segment that runs from <unk> Point , New York , to <unk> , Maine . In Michigan , the highway runs through the UP in two segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system , entering the state at <unk> and ending at St. Ignace ; in between , US 2 briefly traverses the state of Wisconsin . As one of the major transportation <unk> in the UP , US 2 is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern Midwest states . Two sections of the roadway are included as part of the Great Lakes Circle <unk> , and other segments are listed as state @-@ designated Pure Michigan <unk> . There are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along US 2 that date to the <unk> and 1920s . The highway runs through rural sections of the UP , passing through two national and two state forests in the process . 
 The route of what became US 2 was used as part of two Indian trails before European settlers came to the UP , and as part of the Michigan segments of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway and the King 's International Highway auto trails in the early 20th century . The state later included these trails as part of M ‑ 12 when the first state highway <unk> were designated in 1919 . Most of M ‑ 12 was redesignated as part of US 2 when the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 . Since the 1930s , several changes have <unk> the highway 's routing through the UP . One such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with Hurley , Wisconsin , and others pushed an originally inland routing of US 2 closer to the Lake Michigan shoreline . With the creation of the Interstate Highway System , part of US 2 was rerouted to coincide with the new Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) , though in the 1980s , the U.S. Highway was truncated and removed from the I ‑ 75 freeway , resulting in today 's basic form .

 According to a 2006 regional planning committee report , US 2 is a key highway for Michigan , providing its main western gateway . The roadway plays " an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern tier of states in the Midwest " , and is listed on the National Highway System ( NHS ) for its entire length . The NHS is a network of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . Together with M ‑ 28 , US 2 is part of a pair of primary <unk> that bridge the eastern and western sides of the UP . The 305 @.@ 151 miles ( 491 @.@ <unk> km ) of roadway in Michigan is divided into a 109 @.@ 177 @-@ mile ( 175 @.@ 703 km ) western segment and a 195 @.@ <unk> @-@ mile ( 315 @.@ 390 km ) eastern segment , interrupted by a section that runs for 14 @.@ 460 miles ( 23 @.@ 271 km ) in the state of Wisconsin . 
 
 = = = Western segment = = = 
 
 US 2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin for the first time north of downtown Hurley , Wisconsin , and <unk> , Michigan , over the state line that runs along the Montreal River . The highway crosses the river into <unk> County and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown . Running along <unk> Drive , US 2 meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard . The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown <unk> and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway . The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border , which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line . US 2 continues eastward through UP woodlands to the city of <unk> . While bypassing the community of Ramsay , the highway crosses a branch of the Black River . The roadway enters Wakefield on the south side of Sunday Lake , meeting M ‑ 28 at a <unk> in town . As the US Highway leaves Wakefield , it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest , crossing Jackson Creek and two branches of the <unk> Isle River . US 2 and M ‑ 64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the <unk> Isle in the community of <unk> . This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state ; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770 vehicles , compared to the overall average of 5 @,@ 188 vehicles for the highway . At the end of the concurrency , M ‑ 64 turns northerly to run along Lake <unk> . 
 The highway continues parallel to the state line from the <unk> area through the national forest toward <unk> . That unincorporated community is the home of the <unk> High School <unk> , the basketball team featured on a series of ESPN commercials and a documentary series on the Sundance Channel . The area is also where the waters meet ; the rolling hills drain to Lake Superior via the <unk> River , to Lake Michigan via the <unk> and <unk> rivers , or to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers . Also located in the area are the <unk> Wilderness , and the Lac <unk> Desert Indian <unk> , which includes the Lac <unk> Desert Casino and Resort . The highway travels southeasterly from <unk> around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural Iron County . US 2 intersects Federal Forest Highway 16 ( <unk> 16 ) near Golden Lake in <unk> Township in the middle of the national forest . The trunkline then runs along the Iron River as it approaches the city of the same name and meets M ‑ 73 . In town , US 2 intersects M ‑ 189 before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city . 
 US 2 leaves the Ottawa National Forest at Iron River , and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near several small lakes to Crystal Falls , the county seat of Iron County . On the west side of town , US 2 meets US 141 ; the two highways run concurrently along Crystal Avenue . The combined highway turns south onto 5th Street and meets M ‑ 69 's eastern terminus at the intersection between 5th Street and Superior Avenue next to the county <unk> at the top of the hill . US 2 / US 141 runs south out of Crystal Falls to the west of , and parallel to , the <unk> River . The roadway passes Railroad , Kennedy and <unk> lakes and leaves the state of Michigan at the <unk> River , crossing into Florence County , Wisconsin for about 14 miles ( 23 km ) .

 US 2 / US 141 re @-@ enters Michigan where it crosses the <unk> River and subsequently meets M ‑ 95 in <unk> Township north of Iron Mountain and <unk> . The highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on <unk> Avenue into Iron Mountain along the west side of Lake Antoine , parallel to a branch line of the <unk> and Lake Superior Railroad ( <unk> Railroad ) . The road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit of the <unk> Mine . In downtown Iron Mountain at <unk> Street , M ‑ 95 turns west off <unk> Avenue to run across town to <unk> . US 2 / US 141 exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the <unk> Mall . The highway re @-@ enters <unk> Township where US 141 separates to the south to re @-@ enter Wisconsin . US 2 continues eastward parallel to a branch of the Canadian National Railway ( <unk> Railway ) . Both road and rail travel through the community of <unk> , where they pass near the largest paper mill in the UP . The trunkline runs along the main street of Norway , where the highway meets the eastern terminus of US 8 . Then US 2 continues east through rural Dickinson County to Vulcan , passing north of <unk> Lake through the <unk> Country State Forest , before crossing the Sturgeon River in <unk> and passing into <unk> County . 
 In <unk> County , the environment takes on a more agricultural character along US 2 . The highway passes through the edge of the community of <unk> before entering Powers . US 2 comes to a three @-@ way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US 41 . The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and <unk> on the south side of the <unk> Railway . At Harris , the trunkline enters the <unk> Indian Community . Harris is on the <unk> County side of the reservation , but as the highway continues east , it crosses over to <unk> River on the Delta County side . The county line in between not only separates the two communities , but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones . East of <unk> River , the highway crosses the community 's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M ‑ 69 . The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of <unk> . 
 US 2 / US 41 <unk> to four lanes along <unk> Street , which forms the east – west axis of the <unk> street grid . Near downtown , the highway meets M ‑ 35 , which runs along the city 's north – south axis , Lincoln Avenue . The <unk> merge and run north , bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor . Lincoln Avenue runs north carrying four lanes of traffic past the Upper Peninsula State <unk> , site of one of the two state <unk> for the state of Michigan , the only state to have twin <unk> . US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 continues north on Lincoln Avenue past the campus of Bay de <unk> Community College . The four @-@ lane highway crosses the <unk> River just upstream from its mouth near the large Mead Paper Mill and shifts to run immediately next to Little Bay de <unk> . The section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of US 2 in the state : an average of 23 @,@ 977 vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in 2011 . 
 The road turns inland again , and US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 passes to the west of downtown Gladstone . The highway through here is an expressway , four lanes divided by a central median and no <unk> access . Unlike a freeway , the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges . The highway intersects the eastern terminus of County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) and crosses the <unk> Railroad south of the <unk> for 4th Avenue North , where M ‑ 35 separates from the US Highways and turns to the northwest . The expressway continues north parallel to the <unk> Railway , crossing the Days River . Through this area , the trunkline carries a speed limit of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) for car traffic . This is the only road in the UP with a speed limit higher than 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) besides I @-@ 75 , which has a speed limit of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . The expressway segment runs around the upper end of Little Bay de <unk> before ending at Rapid River . In this location , US 41 separates to the north , and US 2 returns to an easterly track as a two @-@ lane road , crossing the Rapid and <unk> rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay . As US 2 crosses southern Delta County , it passes through the western unit of the <unk> National Forest . Near Garden Corners , the highway runs along the shore of Big Bay de <unk> . After the intersection with the northern terminus of M ‑ 183 , US 2 turns inland cutting across the base of the Garden Peninsula and enters Schoolcraft County . 
 As the highway approaches Thompson , US 2 leaves the western unit of the <unk> National Forest and enters the Lake Superior State Forest . The roadway runs along Lake Michigan to <unk> , crossing the <unk> River . The trunkline turns inland approaching <unk> and then turns north @-@ northeast to Blaney Park . The community there is a former logging town @-@ turned @-@ resort at the southern terminus of M ‑ 77 ; the resort was active from the late 1920s but declined by the 1980s . From Blaney Park , US 2 turns due east and crosses into Mackinac County west of Gould City . Where it intersects a former routing , the main highway crosses the <unk> Railway one last time and runs to the south of <unk> to follow the Lake Michigan shoreline through <unk> . After passing the community of <unk> , US 2 crosses the Cut River Bridge , 147 feet ( 45 m ) over the Cut River . The highway crosses into the eastern unit of the <unk> National Forest near <unk> , running between Lake Michigan and <unk> Lake in the process . The road continues along the Lake Michigan shoreline , passing <unk> Spot near <unk> Cap and turning inland immediately west of St. Ignace . The US 2 designation ends at the highway 's partial cloverleaf interchange with I ‑ 75 . The roadway continues easterly into downtown St. Ignace as Business Loop I ‑ 75 ( BL I ‑ 75 ) .

 = = = Indian trail through auto trails = = = 
 
 In 1701 , the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes , rivers and Indian trails . Two of these trails followed parts of the future US 2 . The <unk> – Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline routing of US 2 between <unk> and St. Ignace . The Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace with <unk> <unk> . Marie . 
 In the age of the auto trail , the roads that later formed US 2 through the UP were given a few different highway names . When the original roadways between <unk> and Iron River were completed in late 1915 , the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau ( <unk> ) named the area <unk> and the highway the <unk> Trail . Later the name was extended over the highway to <unk> , and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s ; the name was phased out by the <unk> completely in 1927 . The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway , named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919 . Overall , this highway ran from Portland , Oregon , to Portland , Maine , by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario . Through the UP , the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US 2 , including the section through Florence County , Wisconsin . 
 The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the <unk> . A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle <unk> by seventy years , the route followed " a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ... " This route followed the modern US 2 from <unk> to the M ‑ 94 junction in <unk> , using the modern M ‑ 69 and M ‑ 95 to stay in Michigan . <unk> of the route followed US 41 and M ‑ 35 between Powers and <unk> . The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan . The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. 
 One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well . In 1920 , the King 's International Highway linked Vancouver , British Columbia , to Halifax , Nova Scotia , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior . <unk> had to ship their cars by boat between <unk> <unk> . Marie , Ontario , and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to continue along the auto trail . The <unk> varied on the maps of the time , but its basic route used US 2 through the UP from <unk> to <unk> <unk> . Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960 ; by that time , the auto trail had taken on the Trans @-@ Canada Highway name .

 The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 2 was M ‑ 12 , a designation that was in use by July 1 , 1919 , between <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Marie . The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert <unk> near what is now US 2 near Iron River in 1919 – 20 , although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside US 16 ( Grand River Avenue ) in 1929 south of <unk> . When the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 , US 2 partially replaced M @-@ 12 . Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain , US 2 was routed through Florence , Wisconsin . The former routing of M ‑ 12 from Crystal Falls to <unk> became a new M ‑ 69 when the former M ‑ 69 became US 102 ( now US 141 ) . M ‑ 12 from <unk> south to Iron Mountain was made a part of an extended M ‑ 45 , which is now M ‑ 95 . By the next year , M ‑ 48 was added along US 2 from <unk> to <unk> as part of a larger extension . 
 The first changes to the routing of US 2 itself were made in 1930 with a bypass of downtown <unk> . A larger <unk> was completed in 1933 between Rogers Park and <unk> <unk> . Marie . The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to <unk> and north to <unk> <unk> . Marie ; the former routing was given the M ‑ 121 designation . Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2 / US 141 to a new bridge over the <unk> River between 1932 and 1934 . Downtown <unk> was bypassed in 1934 , and the former route was initially designated M ‑ 54 . 
 The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) changed the <unk> and designations of the highways around <unk> , Thompson and <unk> in the mid @-@ 1930s . The agency rerouted US 2 between <unk> and M ‑ 149 in Thompson , turning the old road back to county control . The section between M ‑ 149 and M ‑ 125 was redesignated as an extension of M ‑ 149 to Thompson , and M ‑ 125 was replaced by a further extension of M ‑ 149 . The last change was to route US 2 along its current alignment in the area , completing the changes on August 2 , 1936 . 
 The MSHD started construction in 1936 on a new road that rerouted US 2 into St. Ignace for the first time . Between <unk> and <unk> , US 2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the <unk> Trail to meet the northern extension of US 31 into the Upper Peninsula . The new routing took US 2 along the <unk> into St. Ignace . US 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and US 2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US 31 to Rogers Park ; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M ‑ 122 . Further changes in the early 1940s <unk> the roadway out near <unk> and Crystal Falls . 
 Additional <unk> were completed by the MSHD to move US 2 to its modern <unk> routing between Gould City and <unk> in 1941 . The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to <unk> and then along the lake to <unk> . The former route through <unk> was turned back to local control as far east as <unk> . From there east , it was numbered just M ‑ 48 , removing US 2 from a concurrency . Another former section into <unk> was added to extend M ‑ 117 . The new highway was <unk> around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II . 
 The western end of US 2 took on two changes in the 1940s . M ‑ 28 was extended along US 2 to the state line at <unk> from its western terminus at Wakefield . A similar extension was made from M ‑ 28 's eastern terminus to <unk> <unk> . Marie in 1948 . The M ‑ 54 designation was renumbered as Business US 2 by 1945 . The eastern M ‑ 28 extension was reversed in 1950 , and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952 .

 With the coming of the Interstate Highway System in Michigan , the MSHD planned to convert the eastern section of US 2 to a freeway between St. Ignace and <unk> St. Marie . In planning maps from 1947 , this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the <unk> . It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas <unk> in September 1955 , or Yellow Book after the cover color , that was released in 1955 as the federal government <unk> plans for the freeway system . The proposed number in 1958 was Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) . 
 The first section of freeway was built in late 1957 or early 1958 between <unk> <unk> and M ‑ 123 north of St. Ignace . The Mackinac Bridge was opened to traffic on November 1 , 1957 ; a new section of freeway and an interchange connected US 2 to the bridge . In 1961 , another new freeway segment closed the gap between the Mackinac Bridge and <unk> <unk> sections . At the time , the I ‑ 75 designation <unk> US 27 on the bridge , and US 2 was shifted to follow I ‑ 75 along the freeways in the St. Ignace area . The former routing of US 2 in downtown St. Ignace was redesignated BL I ‑ 75 . More sections of freeway were opened in 1962 immediately to the south of the newly constructed International Bridge in <unk> <unk> . Marie as well as between <unk> and <unk> . The last two sections opened in 1963 connected the northern end of the freeway at M ‑ 123 to <unk> , and the section between <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Marie . At this time , all of US 2 's former routing became a county road known as Mackinac Trail ( H @-@ 63 ) . 
 The Department of State Highways expanded US 2 / US 41 into an expressway between Gladstone and Rapid River in 1971 . The state built a new bridge over the <unk> River in 1983 , bypassing downtown . MDOT disposed of the former routing of US 2 into downtown in two ways . The western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control . An extension of M ‑ 94 replaced the remainder , including the <unk> Bridge , through downtown . In that same year , the department truncated US 2 to end in St. Ignace by removing it from the I ‑ 75 freeway . The last changes were made to US 2 's routing through Iron River in 1998 , bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town . In 2011 , MDOT raised the speed limit along the expressway section in Delta County from 55 to 65 mph ( 89 to 105 km / h ) , although the speed limit for trucks remains 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) .

 On July 1 , 1924 , the State Administrative Board named M ‑ 12 , the predecessor to US 2 in Michigan , the <unk> Highway to honor Frank P. <unk> , a prominent local citizen who later served in Congress from 1927 to 1933 . In 1929 , the residents of <unk> created a memorial to the veterans of World War I called Memory Lane . The project consisted of <unk> and maple trees planted along US 2 / US 41 west of town . The American Legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers . Later in 1949 , the <unk> Women 's Club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans . Also called Memory Lane , the group planted 140 <unk> and 1 @,@ 840 <unk> , trees and shrubs as a <unk> parkway along 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) of US 2 east of <unk> . 
 Most of US 2 , along with US 23 in the Lower Peninsula , was designated the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway in 1949 . To connect the gap in the routing where US 2 cuts through Wisconsin , M ‑ 95 and M ‑ 69 were used in place of US 2 between Iron Mountain and Crystal Falls . Signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when Governor George W. Romney had them installed . 
 The <unk> Memorial Drive designation was created for the section of US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 between the northern <unk> city limits and County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) in Delta County . The American Veterans ( <unk> ) organization in Michigan petitioned the Michigan Legislature to grant this designation , which was assigned under Public Act 144 in 1959 . 
 Two sections of US 2 are part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour ( <unk> ) : the segment from the Wisconsin state line near <unk> to the M ‑ 28 junction in Wakefield is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour ( <unk> ) , and the segment from the southern M ‑ 35 junction in <unk> to the eastern terminus in St. Ignace is part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( <unk> ) . These two tours were created in May 1986 through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin , Minnesota and Ontario . The section of US 2 between Iron River and Crystal Falls has been named the Iron County Heritage Trail . This Pure Michigan Byway was designated to honor the " rich history of two industries that built a state and nation : mining and logging . " On August 26 , 2007 , MDOT announced that the section of US 2 that runs concurrently with M ‑ 35 in Delta County was being included in the UP <unk> Coast Recreational Heritage Trail .
