 <unk> was first digitally released in some South American countries on 23 September 2011 as a special edition , dubbed the <unk> Sur Edition . This version included a different mix of " <unk> " . On 30 September , the digital download for the standard edition of the album was released in several Latin American and European countries . On 4 October , the album was officially released as a digital download and compact disc in most of these same markets as well as North America ; an iTunes edition was released as a digital download on the iTunes music store . This version included an album @-@ only video , entitled " <unk> " . In Germany , the album was first available on the <unk> label on 4 October and on 11 October through Warner Music . In Canada and Spain , the compact @-@ disc version of the album was available on 25 October . 
 <unk> appeared on a television special in 2011 to promote <unk> . The special featured guest appearances by <unk> <unk> , Ricky <unk> ( of the Mexican band <unk> ) and <unk> la del <unk> . Broadcast by <unk> , the program showcased the fourteen songs on <unk> . <unk> said that he was " happy to do things for Ricardo [ <unk> ] " , elaborating that they met each other " some time ago " and it was " a very special situation " . The show was later <unk> on 5 November by Canal de las <unk> .

 The first single from <unk> is " El Amor " , released on 23 August 2011 . In the United States it reached number one on the Billboard Top Latin Songs chart ( <unk> 's fourth number one on that chart , following " <unk> " , " <unk> " and " El <unk> " ) and number one on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart . It was also a hit in Latin America , reaching number one in Argentina , Mexico , Colombia , Venezuela , Chile , Costa Rica , Panama and Guatemala . The music video for " El Amor " , filmed in black @-@ and @-@ white , was released on 8 September 2011 . It was directed by Ricardo Calderón ( who also directed <unk> 's music video for " <unk> <unk> " ) and filmed in Mexico City . The second single from the album is " <unk> Tú " , a duet with <unk> singer <unk> <unk> . The music video for the song was shot in Guatemala ( around the tropical areas of Antigua Guatemala , <unk> Dulce , the <unk> lake , <unk> <unk> and the <unk> ruins ) and directed by Argentine director Joaquín <unk> . <unk> commented that " this video <unk> the battle on the couple when someone starts to talk ' is the beginning of the end ' " . " <unk> Tú " reached number two on the Billboard Top Latin Songs and number one on the Latin Pop Songs charts . 
 " Mi <unk> Se Me <unk> <unk> <unk> " was released as the third single . <unk> wrote the song for his mother , <unk> <unk> . The music video for the song , released in April 2012 , was filmed at Universal Studios in Los Angeles . It features <unk> and his son , Ricardo <unk> Jr . , and was directed by Robert García . The song was used by American telecommunications corporation AT & T for a <unk> <unk> 900 <unk> commercial featuring <unk> and was released in music stores in May 2012 . The fourth single from the album , " Te <unk> " , was released in July 2012 . The music video for the song was filmed during <unk> 's concerts at <unk> Stadium in Buenos Aires , Argentina during his <unk> World Tour . It marks <unk> 's first music video taken from a live performance . The song reached number ten in Mexico and number one on both the Billboard Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs chart . " Si Tu No <unk> " was released in November 2012 as the set 's fifth and final single , and was intended to promote the re @-@ release of the album . The song , which music video was similar to that of " Te <unk> " , managed to peak at number 14 in Mexico .

 Beginning on 27 January 2012 in <unk> , Mexico , <unk> embarked on a world tour to promote the album . The <unk> World Tour was announced in December 2011 , and visited the Americas . The show consisted of four theatrical sets on a revolving stage ; <unk> performed on each in turn , as it <unk> to each song . Fellow <unk> singer @-@ songwriter <unk> <unk> appeared in several performances , joining <unk> for " <unk> Tú " . The tour was praised by critics and fans . Natalie Torres of <unk> a <unk> reported , " <unk> knows how to handle his ' girls ' , with a mix of attitudes from a ' rough ' male and seductive lyrics " . 
 Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that " <unk> is one of Latin pop ’ s finest <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , sometimes <unk> , sometimes melancholy and especially fond of the play of opposites " . He added , " unlike some of his fellow Latin pop stars , Mr. <unk> is no saccharine lover boy " . The tour broke records for ticket sales , commercial gross and attendance . In Buenos Aires it was the most popular show at <unk> Stadium , with a total attendance of more than 160 @,@ 000 for four consecutive sold @-@ out concerts . In Guatemala City <unk> was the first artist with two consecutive sold @-@ out concerts at <unk> Flores Stadium , with a combined attendance of more than 50 @,@ 000 . As of October 2012 , the tour has been performed for close to one million people in more than eight countries .

 David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album a <unk> positive review , citing <unk> 's return to his more mainstream style after the " stripped @-@ down acoustic effort " <unk> <unk> . He compared ( as did <unk> and other critics ) the production values and musical style of <unk> with past albums Animal <unk> and <unk> . Finally , he stated that " Returning fans will <unk> in this combination of freedom and growth , and appreciate the return of producer Tommy Torres , the man who has been behind the boards for quite a few of <unk> 's most popular releases " ( referring to Torres ' absence from the production of <unk> <unk> ) . 
 A contributor to the Colombian website <unk> commented that " listening to <unk> is a labyrinth to go through , each song is a huge path that seems to have no end , because it involves imagination , it invites you to dream , to charm , to <unk> . But neither leaves behind the problematic requirements of love , its <unk> , <unk> and concerns , as well as its bad times in this joke that 's life " . <unk> was nominated at the <unk> <unk> of 2012 for the " Lo <unk> <unk> ( I Play It All ) " award . On 25 September 2012 , the album received two nominations at the 13th Annual Latin Grammy Awards : Album of the Year and Best Singer @-@ songwriter album .

 = 2003 Pacific typhoon season = 
 
 The 2003 Pacific typhoon season was a slightly below average <unk> period of tropical cyclogenesis exhibiting the development of 31 tropical depressions , of which 21 became named storms ; of those , 14 became <unk> . Though every month with the exception of February and March featured tropical activity , most storms developed from May through October . During the season , tropical cyclones affected the Philippines , Japan , China , the Korean Peninsula , Indochina , and various islands in the western Pacific . 
 The season ran year @-@ round , with the first storm , <unk> , developing west of the Marshall Islands on January 15 . In April , Typhoon <unk> became one of the longest @-@ lasting Pacific <unk> in history and attained <unk> records for its unusually early impacts . Typhoon Imbudo in July caused several deaths and extensive damage across the Philippines and China . In September , Typhoon <unk> became one of the costliest <unk> in recorded history after striking South Korea ; <unk> was also the most intense tropical cyclone of the season with a minimum barometric pressure of 910 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 87 inHg ) . In late November , Typhoon <unk> devastated areas of Yap State in the <unk> States of <unk> . The season closed with the <unk> of a tropical depression east of the Philippines on December 27 . 
 The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean , north of the equator and west of the International Date Line . Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes ; see 2003 Pacific hurricane season . Tropical Storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Tokyo Typhoon Center . Tropical depressions in this basin monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) have the " W " <unk> added to their number . Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA . This can often result in the same storm having two names .

 On March 5 , 2003 , <unk> from the University College London at the Tropical Storm Risk ( <unk> ) <unk> issued an extended range forecast for the typhoon season , noting the likelihood of near average tropical cyclone activity as a result of projected neutral sea surface temperatures . The forecast indicated the potential for 26 @.@ 2 tropical storms , compared to the 10 – and 30 @-@ year average of 27 @.@ 8 and 26 @.@ 3 storms , respectively . The following month , the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26 @.@ 7 , indicating a slightly above average season . Over next two months , however , fluctuations in sea surface temperatures , particularly those in the Central Pacific , caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast . A rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their <unk> to indicate a near @-@ average season in their final August forecast update , which predicted 27 tropical storms . The group was very accurate in their <unk> , with their April and August <unk> being the most accurate . 
 Similarly , <unk> working with the City University of Hong Kong issued a seasonal projection on April 24 , 2003 , indicating the likelihood of a normal or below normal season with 29 total tropical cyclones , 26 tropical storms , and 16 <unk> . As with the <unk> , the group primarily based their forecast numbers on the prevailing status of the El Niño @-@ Southern <unk> . The City University of Hong Kong revised their <unk> on June 24 , 2003 , indicating a slight increase of total tropical cyclones to 30 . The group was also accurate in their <unk> for the entirety of the Northwest Pacific , though their specialized <unk> for the South China Sea were substantially off . 
 During the year , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) issued advisories on tropical cyclones west of the International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula , and north of the equator ; this was due to the agency 's status as the official Regional <unk> Meteorological Center , as designated by the World Meteorological Organization in 1989 . The JMA issued <unk> and analyses four times a day , beginning at 0000 UTC and continuing every six hours . The JMA issued <unk> based on a <unk> tropical cyclone forecast model . The agency estimated 10 minute sustained winds and barometric pressure based on the Dvorak technique and numerical weather prediction . The JTWC also issued warnings on storms within the basin , operating from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii to represent the interests of the United States Armed Forces in the Indian and Pacific <unk> .

 Throughout the season , sea surface temperatures within the western equatorial Pacific were above normal , including those in the South China Sea . Areas of convection persisted year @-@ round in the lower latitudes , particularly around the Philippines . <unk> divergence was also prevalent in the same regions , resulting in enhanced tropical cyclogenesis east of the Philippines in 2003 ; the mean region of development of tropical systems during the year was more southwest than the 1971 – 2000 30 @-@ year average . In 2003 , the JMA monitored 21 tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity ; of those , 14 reached typhoon intensity . Though the number of tropical storms was below average , the ratio between tropical storms and <unk> was 66 % greater than normal . The Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) monitored three additional cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity that were not monitored by the JMA . 
 The season began with the formation of Tropical Storm <unk> on January 15 . After its <unk> five days later , no tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity developed over the next two months . This period of inactivity ended with the formation of Typhoon <unk> in mid @-@ April ; <unk> was one of the longest lived Pacific storms on record and was the first typhoon with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of at least 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) in April since Typhoon Isa in 1997 . Tropical activity was enhanced from May to June , and during this period the JMA monitored four tropical storms , while the PAGASA monitored a fifth storm off the eastern Philippines . Three of the four tropical storms monitored by the JMA approached or hit Japan , including Typhoon <unk> , which brought heavy rainfall and wind across the <unk> Islands and the Korean Peninsula . 
 Tropical activity once again declined towards the second half of June and first half of July . The second half of July , however , featured the development of <unk> Imbudo and <unk> , which both tracked westward across the Philippines before striking areas near <unk> and other regions of southeastern China . Imbudo caused the deaths of 78 people and US $ <unk> million in damage . August was a highly active month for tropical cyclogenesis , with a total of six tropical storms monitored by the JMA , JTWC , and PAGASA . This included <unk> <unk> and <unk> , which also struck southeastern China . Typhoon <unk> earlier in the month made landfall in Japan , resulting in 17 deaths . 
 <unk> was somewhat below average in September , with only one tropical cyclone making landfall , <unk> . However , <unk> was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season and was the costliest with roughly US $ 4 @.@ 8 billion in damage , mostly in South Korea . Tropical cyclogenesis and activity continued to decline after August , with October featuring only three tropical storms . However , two , <unk> and <unk> , reached typhoon intensity ; both stayed away from land . November featured less storms but was <unk> average , with two <unk> developing . The second typhoon , <unk> , devastated portions of Yap State , resulting in approximately $ 1 @.@ 7 million in damage . In December , the JTWC and PAGASA monitored a sole tropical system east of the Philippines , though the JMA did not monitor or classify any tropical cyclones during the month .

 In storm information below , wind @-@ speed advisories differ from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) to the JMA as the JTWC uses the United States criteria of 1 @-@ minute mean to designate maximum sustained winds , while the JMA uses the 10 @-@ minute mean wind criteria to designate tropical cyclone maximum sustained winds . This difference generally results in JTWC maximum winds appearing higher than the maximum winds described by the JMA for the same cyclone .

 On January 11 , the JTWC began monitoring the disturbance that would eventually develop into <unk> near the International Date Line . As the system tracked westward , it gradually moved into a more favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis . On January 14 , surface observations indicated that the low @-@ pressure area had developed a closed , low @-@ level circulation center indicative of a tropical cyclone , satellite imagery remained inconclusive . Nonetheless , the JMA classified the pressure area as a tropical depression west of the Marshall Islands at 0600 UTC on January 15 . The JTWC would follow suit by classifying the storm as such at 1800 UTC later that day . At the time , the depression was tracking west @-@ northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north . Over the next day the system <unk> in convective activity before resuming its previous track and accelerating . At 0000 UTC on January 17 , the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity , though the storm remained <unk> as the JMA continued to classify it as a tropical depression . 
 Throughout January 17 the tropical storm would again <unk> in strength , resulting in a brief <unk> by the JTWC to tropical depression intensity . However , an increase in deep convection resulted in its <unk> as a tropical storm at 1800 UTC that day , followed by the JMA upgrading the system to tropical storm intensity at 1200 UTC on January 18 . As such , the storm received the name <unk> . At roughly the same time , the tropical cyclone began to stall east of the Mariana Islands and curve sharply northeastward . Whilst the JTWC indicated that <unk> peaked in strength late on January 18 with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) , the JMA considered the system to have maintained the same intensity throughout its stint as a tropical storm . <unk> by the same nearby subtropical ridge , <unk> would continue to track towards the northeast into a less favorable tropical cyclone environment . The JMA downgraded <unk> to tropical depression at 1200 UTC on January 20 before the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its low @-@ level circulation center <unk> from the primary mass of convection due to strong wind shear . At 0000 UTC , both the JTWC and JMA discontinued the monitoring of <unk> .

 <unk> developed from a broad area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on April 9 well removed from any <unk> . Shortly after development , <unk> quickly intensified in its early stages , and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis . <unk> slowed afterwards , though the storm attained typhoon intensity on April 14 . <unk> continued and late on April 15 , <unk> reached its peak intensity with winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 46 inHg ) . Following peak intensity , <unk> would begin to track northwest and <unk> in strength , <unk> an additional two times in intensity . On April 21 , the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track <unk> for several days east of Taiwan . However , on April 24 , <unk> would resume a northward track and begin to weaken , and on April 24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on <unk> . Following landfall , <unk> transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on April 25 , which persisted until crossing the International Dateline towards the end of April 2003 . 
 Shortly after developing , <unk> caused two fatalities in <unk> in addition to minor agricultural and infrastructural damage ; similar effects were felt in Guam . Several days later , the typhoon prompted cyclone warnings and other <unk> measures in the Philippines after <unk> indicated the potential for strong winds and rain . However , ultimately any effects in the archipelago associated with <unk> remained minimal . The typhoon also prompted warning products in Taiwan , making it the first April typhoon since 1978 to cause such a feat . Unlike in the Philippines , however , <unk> would bring significant rainfall to Taiwan . Effects from the typhoon were most significant in Japan , particularly in the <unk> Islands . Strong winds , rain , and waves caused US $ 230 @,@ 000 ( ¥ 27 @.@ 8 million ) in agricultural damage on <unk> Island . One person was killed due to injuries resulting from the waves . In <unk> , heavy rainfall , peaking at 196 mm ( 7 @.@ 7 in ) in <unk> Prefecture , was reported . Overall , despite its distance away from land and weak intensity at the time of its sole landfall , <unk> resulted in three fatalities .

 <unk> on May 18 , the JTWC began to monitor an area of persistent disturbed weather associated with a broad low @-@ pressure area southwest of <unk> . Within highly <unk> conditions , the disturbance quickly organized and became classified as a tropical depression at 0000 UTC the following day . In its initial stages , the depression tracked slowly <unk> . However , a <unk> trough forced a weakness in a nearby ridge , allowing for the storm to take a more streamlined , northward path . At 1200 UTC on May 20 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Chan @-@ <unk> . Following the system 's naming , Chan @-@ <unk> temporarily meandered towards the northwest before resuming its northeasterly track . The next day , the storm began to develop an eye ; this was reflected with an upgrade by the JMA to typhoon status at 0600 UTC on May 23 . <unk> intensification followed , and at 1800 UTC that day Chan @-@ <unk> reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) and a minimum pressure of 940 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 76 inHg ) . 
 Following peak intensity , Chan @-@ <unk> began to intake dry air beginning on May 25 . At roughly the same time , the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate towards the northeast . Conditions continued to <unk> as the storm moved further north , and as the cyclone passed east of <unk> , it was downgraded to tropical storm classification . By this time , Chan @-@ <unk> had lost much of its convection due to wind shear . Early on May 27 , Chan @-@ <unk> had fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone , and these remnants continued to track towards the northeast . These extratropical remnants dissipated south of the <unk> Islands the following day . Early in the typhoon 's existence , Chan @-@ <unk> posed a potential threat to Guam , but remained well east of the island . However , after passing to the northeast , winds from the typhoon fanned volcanic ash from the recently <unk> <unk> volcano towards the island , prompting <unk> measures in Guam . <unk> were reported on the island , forcing the cancellation of several flights . As a tropical storm , Chan @-@ <unk> caused some damage to homes and crops on <unk> , mostly due to heavy rains brought forth by the storm . Offshore , a 1 @,@ <unk> ton fishing vessel , the <unk> <unk> , sank during the storm . The ship was valued at $ 16 million .

 Tropical Storm <unk> developed as a tropical depression just off the western coast of Luzon on May 25 . The disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity a few hours after cyclogenesis . However , intensification leveled off as <unk> executed a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall on Luzon on May 27 . Due to land interaction the storm temporarily weakened and <unk> before reforming in the Philippine Sea . Afterwards <unk> began <unk> and reached its peak intensity on May 29 with maximum sustained winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 980 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 94 inHg ) . Following its peak the tropical storm began to deteriorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on May 30 ; these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through Japan before dissipating in the Sea of <unk> on June 4 . 
 The erratic and slow movement of <unk> off the western Philippines was the catalyst for extreme rainfall and flooding , killing 41 persons in the archipelago . Precipitation peaked at <unk> mm ( 28 @.@ 5 in ) near <unk> . Rising <unk> resulted in the temporary <unk> of government offices and numerous mudslides . In addition , strong winds caused widespread power outages . Overall damage from <unk> in the Philippines amounted to <unk> 192 @.@ 3 million ( US $ 3 @.@ 65 million ) . The floods also displaced 8 @,@ 367 people in 1 @,@ <unk> families and destroyed 178 homes . <unk> and its extratropical remnants later brought torrential rainfall and widespread flooding to Japan , particularly in southwestern regions . Rainfall there peaked at <unk> mm ( 28 @.@ 62 in ) . Flood damage was worst in <unk> and <unk> Prefectures , where several buildings were destroyed by <unk> . Other locations in Japan experienced considerable agricultural damage as well as numerous landslides . Overall , <unk> caused roughly $ 28 @.@ 2 million in damage , much of which occurred in Japan , though the entirety of deaths associated with the cyclone took place in the Philippines .

 In late May , an area of disturbed weather began to persist in the South China Sea . The JTWC began to monitor the storm cluster on May 29 . The following day , the JMA reclassified the system as a tropical depression ; initially the system remained highly disorganized due to the lack of deep convection . <unk> moderate wind shear and dry air prevented the cyclone from strengthening significantly in the storm 's early stages . These conditions <unk> as the depression tracked northeast , and at 0000 UTC on June 1 , the JMA upgraded the system to Tropical Storm <unk> . Throughout the course of the day , <unk> continued to strengthen as it accelerated northeast , and peaked in strength with a barometric pressure of 985 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 09 inHg ) and maximum sustained winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) , making it a severe tropical storm . 
 However , upon moving through the <unk> Channel , conditions began to deteriorate due to increased wind shear , weakening the system and resulting in its <unk> to tropical depression status by the JMA at 1200 UTC on June 3 . <unk> continued to become increasingly disorganized as it moved further north , and late that day , the depression transitioned to an extratropical cyclone . The resulting remnants continued to track well east of Japan before dissipating on June 7 . Due to its track away from <unk> , damage remained minimal ; however , as <unk> passed to the south and east of Japan , the storm brought light rainfall to the country , peaking at 81 mm ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) in <unk> , Okinawa .

 A tropical disturbance persisted in the monsoon trough northwest of <unk> on June 7 , and moved westward without development due to wind shear . On June 11 , the shear decreased enough to allow the convection to organize , and the next day the JMA classified it as a tropical depression northeast of <unk> . On June 13 , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm <unk> to the east of the Philippines , and PAGASA gave it the local name " <unk> " . <unk> moved to the northwest and later to the north , parallel to the eastern Philippines , and on June 17 , the JMA upgraded it to typhoon status . The storm rapidly intensified to the east of Taiwan as it developed a well @-@ defined eye , and while doing so passed over the Japanese island of <unk> @-@ <unk> at around <unk> UTC on June 17 . At 0600 UTC on June 18 , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) , while the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . Increased shear weakened the typhoon to tropical storm strengthen on June 19 , and later that day the JMA declared the storm as extratropical near the <unk> Islands . The extratropical remnants of <unk> continued to the northeast , crossing northern Japan on June 20 and dissipating on June 24 . 
 While offshore the Philippines , <unk> dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding and left thousands homeless . The storm caused <unk> 131 million ( PHP , $ 2 @.@ 46 million USD ) in damage and 12 deaths . On the Japanese island of <unk> @-@ <unk> , where wind gusts reached 204 km / h ( 127 mph ) . It also affected Taiwan , where floods covered highways and caused mudslides . In Japan , the storm caused widespread power outages , although damage was minimal , and there were 21 injuries . In South Korea , there was $ 12 @.@ 1 million in damage and two deaths .

 On July 15 , the JMA estimated that a tropical depression formed , and the next day the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression <unk> about <unk> km ( 415 mi ) east of Yap . A subtropical ridge near Okinawa steered the nascent depression to the west @-@ northwest for much of its duration . With warm waters and favorable upper @-@ level conditions , the depression quickly organized , first to Tropical Storm Imbudo on July 17 , and to typhoon status two days later , when PAGASA begin issuing advisories on Typhoon <unk> . Around that time , Imbudo was rapidly intensifying , developing a well @-@ defined eye . At 1200 UTC on July 20 , the JMA estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , and the same time , the JTWC estimated 1 minute sustained winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , making it a super typhoon . Imbudo maintained peak winds for about 12 hours , before undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle . At 0300 UTC on July 22 , Imbudo struck northern Luzon , with 1 minute winds estimated at 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) by the JTWC . It weakened over land , but re @-@ intensified in the South China Sea , striking southern China near Yangjiang , Guangdong on July 24 . Imbudo rapidly weakened , dissipating on July 25 . 
 In the Philippines , officials evacuated over 14 @,@ 000 people . Imbudo was the strongest typhoon to strike since Typhoon <unk> five years prior , The typhoon left widespread areas flooded for several days . Damage was heaviest in the Cagayan Valley , where over 80 @,@ 000 people were displaced by the storm . In Isabela , high winds wrecked most of the banana crop and severely damaged other crops . Throughout the Philippines , Imbudo damaged or destroyed 62 @,@ 314 houses , causing <unk> billion ( 2003 PHP , $ 86 million 2003 USD ) in damage . There were 64 deaths in the country .

 <unk> originated from a tropical depression situated within the monsoon trough to the east of the Philippines on July 15 . Tracking westward , intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central Philippines on July 17 . Upon moving into the South China Sea , conditions allowed for quicker strengthening , and the cyclone reached tropical storm status on July 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) , making it a severe tropical storm . However , atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as <unk> made landfall on <unk> on July 21 , weakening the system . The tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the Gulf of <unk> prior to a final landfall near Hanoi , Vietnam the following day . Tracking inland , the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused <unk> to dissipate over Laos on July 23 . 
 Shortly after development , <unk> tracked through the Philippines , killing two people . After moving into the South China Sea , turbulence produced by the storm resulted in an aviation incident involving a commercial airliner off the western Philippines . Three of the plane 's occupants received minor injuries . In <unk> , <unk> caused heavy rainfall , peaking at 189 mm ( 7 @.@ 44 in ) at a station on <unk> Mountain . The rains resulted in the collapse of 1 @,@ 400 homes and an estimated <unk> ¥ 140 @.@ 27 million ( US $ 16 @.@ 9 million ) in direct economic losses . Effects were worst in Vietnam , where three people were killed . Widespread power outages occurred , and strong winds resulted in agricultural and infrastructural damage , particularly in Vietnam 's northern provinces .

 <unk> spawned from an area of disturbed weather in the Philippine Sea on July 31 . Tracking northwest , favorable conditions allowed for the intensification of the system to tropical storm strength on August 2 . <unk> reached peak intensity later that day with winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of <unk> mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 29 inHg ) . This intensity was held for several hours until less conducive atmospheric conditions slightly weakened the system ; this was followed by <unk> making landfall on southern Taiwan on August 3 . Subsequently , the storm weakened and moved into the Taiwan Strait before making its final landfall near <unk> , China the next day . The storm quickly weakened over the Chinese mainland , and dissipated entirely several hours after landfall . 
 In Taiwan , where <unk> first made landfall , heavy rainfall resulted in flooding . Commercial flights , schools , and rail service in some areas was cancelled in advance of the storm . Precipitation there peaked at 653 mm ( 25 @.@ 71 in ) over a period of nearly two days in <unk> County . <unk> damage also resulted from the rainfall , and was estimated at over <unk> $ 70 million ( US $ 2 million ) . In China , record rainfall was reported . The worst impacted city was <unk> , where losses due to <unk> reached <unk> ¥ 240 million ( US $ 29 million ) and one death was reported . Power outages were also widespread across southeastern China . Due to <unk> drought conditions , 703 cloud <unk> operations took place in order to artificially generate added rainfall ; such operations resulted in moderate precipitation over the targeted area . Overall , <unk> caused roughly $ 31 million in damage and three deaths .

 A tropical depression developed on August 2 southeast of Guam , and gradually intensified while moving to the northwest , becoming a tropical storm on August 3 and a typhoon a day later . <unk> formed an eye and became a large storm by the time it approached Okinawa on August 7 . The typhoon attained peak winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) before weakening slightly while turning to the northeast . <unk> made landfall on the Japanese island of <unk> on August 8 , and later moved across portions of <unk> and <unk> . After weakening to tropical storm status , the cyclone became extratropical on August 9 and dissipated three days later . 
 While passing northeast of the Philippines , the typhoon caused light damage in the archipelago . The eye crossed over Okinawa , where <unk> left 166 @,@ 800 people without power and caused 10 injuries . Near where <unk> first struck Japan , <unk> reported a peak wind gust of 166 km / h ( 103 mph ) , at the time the third strongest on record there . The typhoon also dropped torrential rainfall peaking at <unk> mm ( 26 @.@ 9 in ) . The combination of winds and rainfall caused landslides , particularly on <unk> .

 <unk> originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough east of <unk> State on August 13 . Despite rather favorable conditions , the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August 18 . However , these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later . <unk> was rather rapid upon the storm 's <unk> – the depression reached tropical storm status on August 20 and then typhoon intensity two days later . Shortly after , <unk> made landfall on Luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . The typhoon emerged into the South China Sea as a much weaker tropical storm , though it was able to <unk> over warm waters . Once again at typhoon intensity , <unk> <unk> <unk> before moving over the <unk> Peninsula on its way to a final landfall near <unk> <unk> , Vietnam on August 25 . Quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as <unk> moved across northern Vietnam , where the storm met its demise the following day . 
 <unk> first struck the Philippines , resulting in heavy rainfall and <unk> approximately 1 @,@ 000 families . The flooding caused severe damage and killed one person . <unk> 's effects were much more severe in China . In Hong Kong , eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred as a result of the typhoon 's outer rainbands . However , Guangdong Province , <unk> Province , and Guangxi were the Chinese regions most extensively impacted . The typhoon brought record wind gusts into Guangxi . In those three regions combined , 13 @,@ 000 homes were estimated to have collapsed and a large <unk> of farmland was damaged . Two people were killed in China and economic losses <unk> to ¥ 2 @.@ 1 billion ( US $ 253 million ) . Due to its positioning and track , of all areas in Vietnam only the country 's more northern regions were impacted by <unk> . Flash flooding occurred in earnest in those regions , and 1 @,@ 000 homes were flattened . One person was killed and five others were injured in Vietnam . Overall , the typhoon was responsible for the deaths of four persons .

 The monsoon trough spawned several tropical disturbances in the middle of August , one of which became Tropical Depression <unk> near the Philippines . On August 18 , an area of convection persisted on the southern side of a circulation , developing into a tropical depression east of Luzon . It moved quickly northward and later to the northwest in an area generally unfavorable for strengthening , such as the presence of wind shear and land interaction . On August 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> to the east of Taiwan . Later that day , the circulation passed just 55 km ( 35 mi ) north of <unk> , although the convection was exposed that time . On August 20 , the JMA assessed <unk> as dissipating in the Taiwan Strait , although the JTWC continued advisories until the storm moved ashore in southeastern China . 
 Rainfall in Taiwan reached 69 mm ( 2 @.@ 7 in ) in Ilan County . On the island , the storm left several hundred houses without power due to a lightning strike . On mainland China , rainfall peaked at 101 mm ( 4 @.@ 0 in ) in <unk> , Zhejiang , which were largely beneficial in <unk> drought conditions , while winds gusted to 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) . The storm damaged or destroyed 5 @,@ 880 houses and flooded 1 @,@ <unk> ha ( 3 @,@ 180 acres ) of <unk> fields , causing ¥ 38 @.@ 6 million ( CNY , $ 4 @.@ 7 million USD ) in damage .

 On August 27 , a tropical depression developed about 520 km ( 325 mi ) northwest of Guam , which initially drifted to the southwest before turning to the northwest . On August 29 , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm <unk> , and that day PAGASA began issuing advisories on Tropical Storm <unk> . The storm quickly intensified into a typhoon , after developing an eye in the center . On September 1 , the JMA estimated <unk> attained peak 10 minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) , and the JTWC assessed peak 1 – minute winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) . While near peak intensity , the center of <unk> passed about 45 km ( 30 mi ) south of the southern tip of Taiwan . The typhoon weakened steadily and was a severe tropical storm by the time it made landfall on September 2 just east of Hong Kong . The JTWC estimated landfall winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) , making it the strongest typhoon to strike the Pearl River Delta since Typhoon Hope in 1979 . <unk> rapidly weakened while continuing westward through China , dissipating on September 3 over Guangxi . 
 In the Philippines , <unk> interacted with the monsoon to produce heavy rainfall , killing one person . While in the vicinity , <unk> produced gusts of 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) on <unk> , a Japanese <unk> of Okinawa . Heavy rainfall in Taiwan reached 628 mm ( 24 @.@ 7 in ) in <unk> County , and winds peaked at 176 km / h ( 109 mph ) on Orchid Island before the <unk> was destroyed . The caused about <unk> $ 200 ( <unk> , $ 115 million USD ) in crop damage , and killed three people . Damage was minor in Hong Kong , and four fishermen were missing and presumed drowned after their boat sank .

 Typhoon <unk> formed on September 4 from the monsoon trough in the western Pacific Ocean . It slowly intensified into a tropical storm while moving northwestward , and <unk> became a typhoon on September 8 . That day , it quickly intensified due to favorable conditions , developing a well @-@ defined eye and reaching peak maximum sustained winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) . While near peak intensity , <unk> was <unk> and began turning to the north @-@ northeast . The eyewall soon after passed over the Japanese island of <unk> @-@ <unk> on September 10 , producing the fourth lowest pressure on record in Japan after a pressure of <unk> mbar ( 26 @.@ 9 inHg ) was recorded . With warm waters , <unk> was able to maintain much of its intensity before it made landfall just west of <unk> , South Korea on September 12 . On <unk> Island , <unk> produced a peak wind gust of 216 km / h ( 134 mph ) and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar ( 28 inHg ) , both setting records for the country , and making it the most powerful typhoon to strike South Korea since record @-@ keeping began in the country in 1904 . The typhoon became extratropical in the Sea of Japan the next day , although the remnants persisted for several more days , bringing strong winds to northern Japan . 
 The typhoon first affected the <unk> Islands of Japan . On <unk> @-@ <unk> , strong winds damaged 104 buildings , and 95 % of residents lost power . <unk> dropped heavy rainfall there , including rates of 58 @.@ 5 mm ( 2 @.@ 30 in ) in an hour , and 402 @.@ 5 mm ( 15 @.@ 85 in ) in 24 hours , the latter setting a record .

 In the middle of September , the monsoon trough spawned a rapidly organizing disturbance east @-@ northeast of Luzon , with weak wind shear and favorable conditions . On September 16 , the JMA classified it as a tropical depression , and the JTWC initiated advisories the next day . The system moved to the northwest due to the subtropical ridge to the northeast and later to the north . On September 18 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> @-@ <unk> , the same day that PAGASA classified it as Tropical Storm <unk> . An eastward @-@ moving trough turned the storm to the northeast , bringing the track over Okinawa and <unk> <unk> on September 19 . <unk> @-@ <unk> continued gradually intensifying , becoming a typhoon on September 20 to the southeast of Japan . That day , the JMA estimated peak winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) , and the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) on September 21 , after <unk> @-@ <unk> developed a well @-@ defined eye . The typhoon weakened due to increasing wind shear , deteriorating to severe tropical storm status on September 22 before JMA declared it extratropical on September 23 . The remnants of <unk> @-@ <unk> continued to the northeast , exited the basin on September 24 , and eventually struck southern Alaska on September 25 . 
 Wind gusts in Okinawa reached 115 km / h ( 72 mph ) , while on the volcanic island of <unk> @-@ <unk> , gusts reached <unk> km / h ( 133 mph ) . On the Japanese mainland , winds gusted to 126 km / h ( 78 mph ) at <unk> , <unk> . <unk> @-@ <unk> dropped heavy rainfall while near Japan , peaking at 316 mm ( 12 @.@ 4 in ) on <unk> @-@ <unk> .

 Towards the end of September , the monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance east @-@ northeast of Yap , which became a tropical depression on September 24 . There were initially several <unk> , with a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast increasing outflow . After slowing and turning to the northeast , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm <unk> on September 26 . After the storm developed a large eye feature , the JTWC upgraded it to typhoon status on September 27 , although the JMA did not follow suit until the following day while near <unk> @-@ <unk> . Also that day , <unk> passed 95 km ( 60 mi ) west of Iwo Jima , and the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . The JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , before an approaching trough caused the typhoon to accelerate northeastward . The convection diminished near the center , causing <unk> to become extratropical on September 30 . The remnants continued generally northeastward through the <unk> Islands , eventually passing south of mainland Alaska on October 7 . 
 On <unk> @-@ <unk> , Typhoon <unk> produced sustained winds of 102 km / h ( 63 mph ) , with gusts to 200 km / h ( 124 mph ) , which was the third strongest on record for the station . Rainfall there reached 183 mm ( 7 @.@ 2 in ) . Wind gusts on Iwo Jima peaked at 109 km / h ( 68 mph ) .

 In the middle of October , an area of convection persisted along the monsoon trough between Luzon and Guam , developing into a tropical depression on October 17 . The same monsoon trough later spawned Typhoon <unk> to the east . For several days , the system remained disorganized while drifting to the west @-@ northwest due to weak steering currents south of the subtropical ridge . On October 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> , and by that time the storm had begun drifting to the northeast . With favorable outflow , <unk> quickly intensified into a typhoon on October 20 after developing an eye , and two days later , the JMA estimated peak winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . The JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) around the time the well @-@ defined eye had expanded to 37 km ( 23 mi ) . Subsequently , the typhoon accelerated northeastward into the westerlies and began weakening due to increasing wind shear and dry air . On October 26 , <unk> became extratropical to the east of Japan and dissipated the next day . The passage of the typhoon caused surface <unk> a concentration in the ocean to increase 30 @-@ fold .

 The same monsoon trough that spawned Typhoon <unk> also produced an area of convection to the north @-@ northeast of Guam , becoming a tropical depression on October 19 . The system moved northwestward and later turned to the northeast around the subtropical ridge . With low wind shear and favorable outflow , the convection became better organized , and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm <unk> on October 21 . After an eye began to form , <unk> was upgraded to typhoon status the next day . An approaching trough caused <unk> to accelerate northeastward while also increasing outflow . On October 24 , the JMA estimated peak winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) while the JTWC estimated winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , an unusually high intensity for 30 ° N. Subsequently , <unk> rounded the subtropical ridge and began moving to the east @-@ southeast , beginning a nearly week @-@ long loop . The cold front had passed to the north and failed to bring the typhoon northeastward . 
 Increasing wind shear weakened the convection , and <unk> deteriorated into a severe tropical storm on October 26 . The next day , it began moving westward while passing about 345 km ( 215 mi ) north of Wake Island . A large eye of 110 km ( 70 mi ) in diameter developed , and on October 28 , the JMA re @-@ upgraded <unk> to typhoon status . The next day , the typhoon turned to the northeast due to another approaching trough . With decreasing wind shear and warmer waters , <unk> re @-@ intensified significantly on October 29 , reaching a secondary peak of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) according to JMA , and 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) according to JTWC . The storm moved very closely along the track it took several days prior . Increasing wind shear on October 30 caused rapid weakening , resulting in the eye dissipating . By the next day , the center was exposed , and <unk> became extratropical , later exiting the basin on November 1 . The remnants weakened , later turning to the southeast and dissipating on November 11 southwest of California .

 Late in October , an area of convection persisted northwest of <unk> and quickly organized into a tropical depression on October 29 . Moving west @-@ northwestward toward the Philippines due to a ridge to the east , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm <unk> on October 30 . With minimal wind shear , the storm strengthened further and developed a large eye . The JTWC upgraded <unk> to typhoon status on October 31 , estimating peak 1 minute winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) , although the JMA estimated the storm only attained peak 10 minute winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . Early on November 1 , <unk> made landfall on northeastern Luzon in the Philippines , south of <unk> . The storm weakened over land and emerged into the South China Sea . By that time , it was moving northward along the periphery of the ridge to the east . On November 2 , <unk> turned to the northeast , passing just east of Taiwan . The next day , it weakened to tropical depression status , and after <unk> offshore eastern Taiwan , <unk> continued northeastward . It became extratropical on November 5 and dissipated the next day near southern Japan . 
 In the Philippines , <unk> dropped about 150 mm ( 6 in ) of rainfall , which flooded the Cagayan River and killed four people . In Taiwan , rainfall reached <unk> mm ( 21 @.@ 8 in ) in <unk> County . On the Japanese island of <unk> , rainfall totaled 197 mm ( 7 @.@ 8 in ) , which broke the <unk> and daily record for the station in November .

 A tropical depression developed near Yap on November 11 . The system intensified gradually as it tracked quickly westward toward the Philippines . An anticyclone <unk> allowed for strengthening , and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> on November 12 . Simultaneously , the cyclone entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration , which named it Tropical Storm <unk> . At around 1600 UTC on November 13 , <unk> made landfall on northern <unk> Island in the Philippines before traversing the remainder of the archipelago from east to west . The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea weakened but quickly re @-@ intensified while continuing to the west @-@ northwest . The JTWC estimated peak winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) on November 16 , and later that day , the JMA upgraded the storm to typhoon status , estimating peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . On November 18 , <unk> passed near southwestern <unk> and weakened , with the convection diminishing from the circulation . By the next day , the system weakened to tropical depression status , and dissipated shortly after moving ashore over <unk> , China . 
 In the Philippines , <unk> produced strong winds , heavy rainfall , and rough seas . The storm caused widespread power outages and ferry disruptions . According to the PAGASA in its post @-@ storm report , a total of 13 people lost their lives during the storm . On <unk> , the storm helped end one of the worst summer droughts in almost 65 years , although it also left heavy crop damage , <unk> 64 @,@ 000 ha ( 160 @,@ 000 acres ) of fields and killing 400 head of livestock . With about 800 homes destroyed , damage on <unk> amounted to $ 197 million ( 2003 USD ) . Effects were minor in mainland China .

 Typhoon <unk> formed on November 18 from the monsoon trough to the west of the Marshall Islands . Early in its duration , it moved generally to the west or west @-@ southwest . On November 21 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm <unk> , and two days later , it strengthened into a typhoon , developing an eye . <unk> later began a prolonged movement to the northwest , during which it passed near several islands in Yap State . The typhoon reached peak intensity on November 26 , with peak 10 – minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . It later weakened due to a variety of unfavorable conditions , and after <unk> to the northeast , <unk> became extratropical south of Japan on December 2 . 
 Typhoon <unk> first affected <unk> with gusty winds , and later it damaged or destroyed about 200 homes in <unk> State . There , high waves flooded roads and homes , while high winds damaged crops . Damage was heaviest in Yap State , mostly in the small <unk> <unk> and <unk> Island . On both islands , the typhoon contaminated the water supply and wrecked the crops . Rainfall reached 263 mm ( 10 @.@ 35 in ) on <unk> , and gusts reached 158 km / h ( 98 mph ) . Throughout the <unk> , damage totaled about $ 1 @.@ 7 million , although there were no deaths . The damage prompted the <unk> government to declare two states as disaster areas , as well as a disaster declaration from the United States federal government . While <unk> was becoming extratropical , it became the first typhoon in December to threaten Japan in 13 years . The storm dropped rainfall that resulted in mudslides and flight <unk> .

 An area of convection formed on May 16 to the southwest of <unk> , located within an area of weak wind shear . The next day , the JMA and the JTWC both classified the system as a tropical depression . The convection was disorganized in association with multiple circulation centers , although it gradually organized . Moving westward initially , the depression turned more to the north into an area of increasing wind shear . On May 19 , the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm <unk> , and on the same day , PAGASA classified it as Tropical Depression <unk> . Soon after , the convection decreased from the center , and by May 20 , all warning agencies had discontinued advisories . 
 On July 9 , PAGASA classified a system as Tropical Depression Falcon , off the west coast of the Philippines . The JMA also briefly initiated advisories before dropping them later on July 9 . Later in the month , PAGASA briefly issued advisories on Tropical Depression <unk> on July 30 off the east coast of <unk> . The depression dissipated the next day , causing about <unk> million ( PHP , $ 145 @,@ 000 USD ) in damage . The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression north of Luzon on August 18 , with PAGASA naming it <unk> . There were several <unk> in the region , with Tropical Storm <unk> to the northeast near Taiwan , and the overall system moved generally westward . PAGASA briefly classified <unk> as a tropical storm on August 19 before ending advisories the next day . The system spread rainfall across China , reaching 82 @.@ 4 mm ( 3 @.@ 24 in ) in <unk> , <unk> . 
 On September 5 , former Hurricane <unk> crossed the International Date Line into the basin . By that time , the circulation was largely exposed from the convection , and the center quickly dissipated . Later in the month , the monsoon trough spawned a disturbance east of the Philippines that PAGASA classified as Tropical Depression <unk> on September 15 . The system moved westward but never intensified , dissipating west of Luzon on September 19 . The broad system also spawned Typhoon <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 In October , the JTWC classified Tropical Depression <unk> early in the month off the west coast of Luzon . With weak steering currents , the system moved slowly southwestward before <unk> to the northwest . On October 10 , the depression dissipated just off the coast of southern China . On October 5 , the JMA monitored a tropical depression southeast of Taiwan that later passed near the island , producing heavy rainfall that peaked at 153 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) in Ilan County . A few days later , the JTWC monitored Tropical Depression <unk> , which developed on October 12 after an extratropical storm produced an area of convection . Described as a subtropical low , the depression moved generally northeastward toward Japan due to an approaching cold front . The depression moved through <unk> and <unk> before dissipating on October 13 . The depression dropped 285 mm ( 11 @.@ 2 in ) of rainfall in <unk> , while strong winds associated reached 217 km / h ( 135 mph ) through a storm @-@ produced <unk> . The winds knocked over two cranes , killing two people , and left about 9 @,@ 000 homes without power . The depression also killed two people due to <unk> . On October 16 , the JMA briefly classified a tropical depression to the east of the <unk> Islands . On October 22 , a tropical depression developed in the South China Sea , classified by PAGASA as <unk> . The system moved eastward and crossed <unk> before dissipating on October 24 . In the Philippines , the depression killed one person and caused minor damage . Also in October , the monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression in the Gulf of Thailand , which moved northwestward and crossed into the Indian Ocean , dropping heavy rainfall in Thailand . 
 In mid @-@ November , the JMA briefly tracked a weak tropical depression near Wake Island . The agency also briefly tracked a tropical depression off the coast of Vietnam on December 16 . It finally dissipated on December 17 , with the pressure and winds unknown . The final system of the year was a tropical depression that originated out of the monsoon trough on December 24 east of the Philippines . After initially moving to the west , it turned to the south , and the JTWC estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm . During this time , PAGASA classified it as Tropical Storm <unk> . The system made landfall in northeastern <unk> and dissipated on December 27 , bringing heavy rainfall .

PAGASA assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area of responsibility and any tropical cyclone that might move into their area of responsibility . Should the list of names for a given year prove to be insufficient , names are taken from an auxiliary list , the first 10 of which are published each year before the season starts . The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2007 season . Names that were not assigned are marked in gray .

 The names Imbudo and <unk> were retired by the <unk> / <unk> Typhoon Committee . The names <unk> and <unk> were chosen to replace Imbudo and <unk> respectively . While <unk> was requested by Hong Kong to be removed in the list , and was replaced by <unk> . The Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) announced that the name <unk> had its name retired due to extensive damage . The name Hanna was chosen to replace <unk> . Also , the name " <unk> " was replaced by " <unk> " , after it was found that <unk> was a <unk> .

 An <unk> is an organic molecule that features a three @-@ membered <unk> containing oxygen , nitrogen , and carbon . In their largest application , <unk> are <unk> in the industrial production of <unk> . <unk> derivatives are also used as specialized reagents in organic chemistry for a variety of <unk> , including alpha <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of <unk> , and other <unk> transfer reactions . <unk> also serve as precursors to <unk> and participate in [ 3 + 2 ] <unk> with various <unk> to form substituted five @-@ membered <unk> . <unk> <unk> derivatives effect asymmetric oxygen transfer to <unk> <unk> as well as other substrates . Some <unk> also have the property of a high barrier to <unk> of the nitrogen , allowing for the possibility of <unk> at the nitrogen center . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 <unk> derivatives were first reported in the mid @-@ 1950s by <unk> and subsequently by <unk> and Horner and <unk> . Whereas oxygen and nitrogen typically act as <unk> due to their high <unk> , <unk> allow for <unk> transfer of both <unk> . This unusual reactivity is due to the presence of the highly strained three membered ring and the relatively weak N @-@ O bond . <unk> tend to attack at the <unk> nitrogen when the nitrogen <unk> is small ( R1 = H ) , and at the oxygen atom when the nitrogen <unk> has greater <unk> bulk . The unusual electronics of the <unk> system may be exploited to perform a number of oxygen and nitrogen transfer reactions including , but not limited to : α @-@ <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , selective oxidation of sulfides and <unk> , <unk> of N @-@ <unk> and N @-@ <unk> . 
 The <unk> process for the industrial production of <unk> through the oxidation of ammonia with hydrogen <unk> in the presence of <unk> was developed in the early 1970s . 
 <unk> <unk> proved useful in the syntheses of complex natural product , such as <unk> which is marketed as a chemotherapy agent . Both the <unk> <unk> total synthesis and the <unk> <unk> total synthesis feature asymmetric α @-@ <unk> with <unk> .

 = = = N @-@ H , N @-@ <unk> , N @-@ <unk> = = = 
 
 The two main approaches to synthesis of N @-@ H , N @-@ <unk> , and N @-@ <unk> are oxidation of <unk> with <unk> ( A ) and <unk> of <unk> ( B ) . 
 Additionally , oxidation of <unk> <unk> and oxidation of <unk> with <unk> <unk> may yield <unk> <unk> . Some <unk> have the unique property of <unk> stable nitrogen atoms at room temperature due to an <unk> barrier of 24 to 31 <unk> / <unk> . <unk> <unk> where <unk> is entirely due to <unk> stable nitrogen are reported .

 In the late 1970s and early 1980s Franklin A. Davis synthesized the first N @-@ <unk> , which act exclusively as oxygen transfer reagents , and are the most predominantly used class of <unk> today . While originally synthesized with <unk> and the phase transfer catalyst <unk> chloride , an improved synthesis using <unk> as the <unk> is now most prevalent . 
 Many N @-@ <unk> are used today , each with slightly different properties and reactivity . These reagents are summarized in the table below . 
 
 = = = <unk> <unk> = = = 
 
 With highly electron withdrawing <unk> <unk> , <unk> exhibit reactivity more similar to that of <unk> than typical <unk> . Notably , <unk> <unk> certain C @-@ H bonds with high selectivity . <unk> <unk> may be synthesized by <unk> a <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> and a metal fluoride to act as an HF <unk> .

 <unk> are <unk> in the <unk> process for the production of <unk> . Many millions of kilograms of <unk> are produced annually by this method that involves a step wherein ammonia is <unk> in the presence of methyl <unk> <unk> to give the <unk> : 
 Me ( <unk> ) C = O + <unk> + <unk> → Me ( <unk> ) <unk> + H2O 
 In subsequent steps the <unk> is converted to the <unk> , which is the immediate en route to <unk> : 
 Me ( <unk> ) <unk> + <unk> → Me ( <unk> ) C = <unk> + H2O

 = = = = α @-@ <unk> of <unk> = = = = 
 
 α @-@ <unk> , or <unk> , are an important synthetic motifs present in many natural <unk> α @-@ <unk> have been synthesized in many ways , including reduction of α @-@ <unk> , substitution of a <unk> for a leaving group and direct oxidation of an <unk> . <unk> ( <unk> ) - ( <unk> <unk> ) ( <unk> ) and N @-@ <unk> are the most common <unk> sources of oxygen implemented in this process . One advantage of using N @-@ <unk> is that higher <unk> induction is almost invariably observed relative to <unk> and other <unk> . High yield ( 77 @-@ 91 % ) and <unk> ( 95 : 5 - 99 : 1 ) are reported for α @-@ <unk> with the Evans ' <unk> auxiliary with N @-@ <unk> as the <unk> . <unk> induction has been demonstrated with many other <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> , including <unk> and <unk> . 
 Extensive work has been reported on asymmetric <unk> of <unk> <unk> with <unk> derivatives , achieving moderate to high enantiomeric excess . The commonly accepted proposed transition state that <unk> this <unk> outcome involves an open transition state where the <unk> bulk of R1 determines the face of approach . 
 The selectivity of some <unk> may be drastically improved in some cases with the addition of coordinating groups alpha to the <unk> ring as <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the table above . In these instances it is proposed that the reaction proceeds through a closed transition state where the metal <unk> is stabilized by <unk> from the sulfate and coordinating groups on the camphor skeleton . 
 α @-@ <unk> with <unk> has been widely implemented in total synthesis . It is a key step in both the <unk> <unk> total synthesis and the <unk> <unk> total synthesis . Additionally , <unk> implemented the transformation in his synthesis of the <unk> @-@ <unk> ( <unk> 1 @,@ 7 @-@ <unk> [ 5 @.@ 5 ] <unk> @-@ 3 @-@ <unk> ) System of <unk> acid . 
 
 = = = = <unk> of <unk> = = = = 
 
 <unk> of <unk> is a common reaction because epoxides can be <unk> in a number of useful ways . <unk> , laboratory <unk> is carried out with <unk> or other <unk> . <unk> have been found to be useful for the formation of highly acid sensitive epoxides . ( − ) <unk> was synthesized via <unk> <unk> as a late stage transformation as seen below . 
 Another transformation of high synthetic utility is asymmetric <unk> . A number of asymmetric <unk> exist : the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> @-@ Colonna <unk> . These methods require specific functionality in order to achieve selectivity . The <unk> <unk> is specific to <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> requires <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> requires α @-@ β <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> act <unk> on many <unk> <unk> . It has even possible to effect <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> unit . Further investigation into these reactions may be required before levels of <unk> excess become practical for large scale synthesis . <unk> et al. have investigated asymmetric <unk> with a <unk> <unk> salt using <unk> as the stoichiometric <unk> seen below . 
 
 = = = = <unk> of <unk> <unk> = = = = 
 
 <unk> <unk> are known to <unk> <unk> <unk> with remarkable <unk> , and <unk> . This is a highly <unk> transformation , and similar reactivity and <unk> is seldom rivaled , especially considering the <unk> nature of the <unk> . <unk> <unk> show high selectivity toward tertiary <unk> . <unk> of primary <unk> and <unk> of a compound with two <unk> sites have never been observed . <unk> of <unk> is very high , often 95 - 98 % . ( <unk> of <unk> may be further enhanced by the addition of a fluoride salt ) .

 <unk> with <unk> or <unk> <unk> are capable of nitrogen atom transfer , although this reactivity has received considerably less attention . 
 
 = = = = <unk> of N @-@ <unk> = = = = 
 
 <unk> of <unk> with N @-@ <unk> <unk> is quite versatile in the breadth of possible <unk> and corresponding products . <unk> may be derived from the <unk> of secondary or tertiary <unk> , <unk> and <unk> may be formed from their corresponding <unk> and <unk> , <unk> may be formed from <unk> and α @-@ <unk> may be formed by attack of corresponding <unk> .

 The transfer of <unk> <unk> is more difficult than that of <unk> <unk> , although , unlike amine transfer by <unk> , there are no alternative methods that directly transfer <unk> <unk> . <unk> transfer has primarily been performed using <unk> and <unk> as <unk> . Very few transfers of <unk> <unk> to carbon <unk> have been successfully performed , although some do exist in the literature . 
 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 
 <unk> have been found to undergo <unk> reactions via a radical mechanism when <unk> with <unk> light or in the presence of a single electron transfer reagent such as <unk> <unk> <unk> undergo ring expansions to the corresponding <unk> . <unk> , the migrating <unk> is determined by a <unk> effect where the group trans to the lone pair on the nitrogen will always be the predominant migration product . In light of this effect , it is possible to take advantage of the <unk> nitrogen due to high <unk> barrier to direct the <unk> . This phenomenon is demonstrated by observed <unk> in the <unk> below . In the <unk> on the left the <unk> unfavorable product is observed exclusively , while in the reaction on the right the product derived from the less stable radical intermediate is favored . 
 <unk> takes advantage of this <unk> as the key step in his synthesis of ( + ) <unk> , a natural medicine classified by the <unk> as possibly effective in the treatment of <unk> <unk> and the sexual problems caused by selective <unk> <unk> inhibitors . 
 It is also notable that <unk> will <unk> <unk> to <unk> . <unk> @-@ trans selectivity of the resulting <unk> is poor , however , yields are good to excellent . It is thought that some <unk> <unk> over time through a <unk> intermediate .

 <unk> undergo <unk> reactions with <unk> to afford a number of unique five membered <unk> , as depicted in the figure below . This reactivity is due to the strained three membered ring and weak N @-@ O bond .

 The Battle of <unk> ( also known as the Battle of <unk> , Battle of <unk> and Battle of <unk> ; German : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , on 11 November 1805 was an engagement in the Napoleonic Wars during the War of the Third Coalition . <unk> ( modern <unk> ) is located in the <unk> Valley , on the River <unk> , 73 kilometers ( 45 mi ) upstream from Vienna , Austria . The river makes a crescent @-@ shaped curve between <unk> and nearby <unk> an der <unk> and the battle was fought in the flood plain between the river and the mountains . 
 At <unk> a combined force of Russian and Austrian troops trapped a French division commanded by <unk> <unk> <unk> . The French division was part of the newly created VIII Corps , the so @-@ called Corps <unk> , under command of <unk> <unk> . In pursuing the Austrian retreat from <unk> , <unk> had over @-@ extended his three divisions along the north bank of the <unk> . Mikhail <unk> <unk> , commander of the Coalition force , <unk> <unk> to send <unk> 's division into a trap and French troops were caught in a valley between two Russian columns . They were rescued by the timely arrival of a second division , under command of Pierre <unk> de l <unk> . The battle extended well into the night . Both sides claimed victory . The French lost more than a third of their participants , and <unk> 's division experienced over 40 percent losses . The Austrians and Russians also had heavy <unk> to 16 <unk> perhaps the most significant was the death in action of Johann Heinrich von <unk> , one of Austria 's most capable chiefs of staff . 
 The battle was fought three weeks after the Austrian capitulation at Ulm and three weeks before the Russo @-@ Austrian defeat at the Battle of <unk> . After <unk> Austria withdrew from the war . The French demanded a high indemnity and Francis II abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor , releasing the German states from their allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 In a series of conflicts from 1803 @-@ 15 known as the Napoleonic Wars , various European powers formed five coalitions against the First French Empire . Like the wars sparked by the French Revolution ( 1789 ) , these further revolutionized the formation , organization and training of European armies and led to an unprecedented <unk> , mainly due to mass conscription . Under the leadership of Napoleon , French power rose quickly as the Grande <unk> conquered most of Europe , and collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 . Napoleon 's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813 – 14 campaigns , resulting in the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France . Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815 , known as the Hundred Days , his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo , the pursuit of his army and himself , his abdication and banishment to the Island of Saint Helena concluded the Napoleonic Wars .

 From 1803 @-@ 06 the Third Coalition fought the First French Empire and its client states ( see table at right ) . Although several naval battles determined control of the seas , the outcome of the war was decided on the continent , predominantly in two major land operations in the <unk> valley : the Ulm campaign in the upper <unk> and the Vienna campaign , in the middle <unk> valley . 
 Political conflicts in Vienna delayed Austria 's entry into the Third Coalition until 1805 . After hostilities of the War of the Second Coalition ended in 1801 , <unk> <unk> emperor 's <unk> advantage of the subsequent years of peace to develop a military restructuring plan . He carefully put this plan into effect beginning in 1803 – 04 , but implementation was incomplete in 1805 when Karl Mack , Lieutenant Field Marshal and <unk> @-@ General of the Army , implemented his own restructuring . Mack bypassed Charles ' methodical approach . <unk> in the field , Mack 's plan also undermined the overall command and <unk> structure . Regardless , Mack sent an enthusiastic report to Vienna on the military 's readiness . Furthermore , after <unk> Napoleon 's maneuvers in <unk> , Mack also reported to Vienna on the weakness of French <unk> . His reports convinced the war party advising the emperor , Francis II , to enter the conflict against France , despite Charles ' own advice to the contrary . Responding to the report and rampant anti @-@ French fever in Vienna , Francis dismissed Charles from his post as <unk> and appointed his <unk> brother @-@ in @-@ law , <unk> Ferdinand , as commander . 
 The inexperienced Ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement for the capable Charles , having neither maturity nor aptitude for the assignment . Although Ferdinand retained nominal command , day @-@ to @-@ day decisions were placed in the hands of Mack , equally ill @-@ suited for such an important assignment . When Mack was wounded early in the campaign , he was unable to take full charge of the army . Consequently , command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp , Prince of <unk> , an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army .

 The campaign in the upper <unk> valley began in October , with several clashes in <unk> . Near the Bavarian town of <unk> , 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) northwest of <unk> , on 8 October the 1st Regiment of <unk> , part of <unk> 's Reserve Cavalry Corps , and grenadiers of <unk> ' V Corps surprised an Austrian force half its size . The Austrians were <unk> in a line and unable to form their defensive squares quickly enough to protect themselves from the 4 @,@ 000 <unk> and 8 @,@ 000 grenadiers . Nearly 3 @,@ 000 Austrians were captured and over 400 were killed or wounded . A day later , at another small town , <unk> south of the <unk> <unk> French 59th Regiment of the Line stormed a bridge over the <unk> and , <unk> , chased two large Austrian columns toward Ulm . 
 The campaign was not entirely bad news for Vienna . At <unk> , Johann von <unk> arranged his 25 @,@ 000 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and , on 11 October , the overly confident General of Division Pierre <unk> de l <unk> attacked <unk> 's force with fewer than 8 @,@ 000 men . The French lost 1 @,@ 500 men killed and wounded . Aside from taking the Imperial Eagles and <unk> of the 15th and 17th <unk> , <unk> 's force also captured 900 men , 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons . 
 <unk> 's victory was a singular success . On 14 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north : one under Johann <unk> <unk> headed toward <unk> to secure the bridge there , and the other under Franz von <unk> went north with most of the heavy artillery . <unk> the opportunity , Marshal Michel <unk> <unk> the rest of his VI Corps forward to re @-@ establish contact with <unk> , who was still north of the <unk> . In a two @-@ <unk> attack <unk> sent one division to the south of <unk> on the right bank of the <unk> . This division began the assault at <unk> . At the same time another division crossed the river to the east and moved west against <unk> 's position . After clearing Austrian <unk> from a bridge , the French attacked and captured a strategically located <unk> at the top of the hill at bayonet point . The Austrian cavalry unsuccessfully tried to fend off the French , but the Austrian infantry broke and ran . In this engagement alone , the Austrians lost more than half their reserve artillery park , 6 @,@ 000 ( out of 8 @,@ 000 total participants ) dead , wounded or captured and four colors . <unk> 's column also failed to destroy the bridges across the <unk> . 
 Napoleon 's lightning campaign exposed the Austrian <unk> command structure and poor supply apparatus . Mack completely <unk> the French <unk> and scattered his forces ; as the French defeated each unit separately , the surviving Austrians withdrew toward the Ulm fortifications . Napoleon arrived to take personal command of close to 80 @,@ 000 men . At Ulm on 16 October Karl Mack surrendered his <unk> army of 20 @,@ 000 infantry and 3 @,@ 273 cavalry . The officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until formally exchanged for French officers captured by the Austrians , an agreement to which they held .

 The few Austrian corps not trapped at Ulm withdrew toward Vienna , with the French in close pursuit . A Russian army under Gen. Mikhail <unk> also <unk> away from the French , withdrawing to the east . At the <unk> river on 22 October it joined with the retreating Austrian corps commanded by Michael von <unk> . On 5 November the Coalition forces held a successful rearguard action in <unk> . On 7 November the Russians arrived in St. <unk> and crossed the <unk> river the next day . Late on 9 November they destroyed the bridges across the <unk> , holding the last one at the hamlet of Stein , near the village <unk> , until the late afternoon . 
 
 = = = Battlefield = = = 
 
 To the east of Stein , 2 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) down an old road , lay <unk> , with its small population of a few hundred , at the confluence of the stream of that name and the <unk> . To the west of Stein the <unk> made a large curve , creating a crescent @-@ shaped floodplain between it and the mountains . At the far western end of the floodplain , where the mountains came down almost to the river 's edge , was <unk> with its castle , known as <unk> <unk> . The castle had served as a prison for Richard I of England in <unk> . In 1645 – 46 , during the Thirty Years War , the Swedes had fortified the castle and then demolished it when they withdrew . It stands at 159 meters ( 522 ft ) , on the highest ridge of a mountain <unk> with <unk> and pinnacles of granite . Because the mountain was sparsely <unk> , it was difficult to distinguish the ruins from the rocks . <unk> canyons cut through the mountain , and widen into the plain below . Between <unk> and Stein , on the flood plain , lay the hamlets of <unk> and <unk> . Near the hamlets , the <unk> flood plain was at its <unk> , extending at the most 762 meters ( 2 @,@ 500 ft ) from the base of the <unk> mountain to the bank of the river . 
 The region was known for its wine . Since the 15th century the local inhabitants practiced <unk> and the wine producers formed St. Paul <unk> ' Guild in <unk> , the oldest such guild in the German @-@ speaking world . <unk> vineyards extended up the sides of the <unk> River until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation . The <unk> plain supported both <unk> and agriculture . As the terrain became <unk> , the vines grew in terraces built from the dark <unk> , primordial rock . From <unk> to <unk> the river makes its wide curve ; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line @-@ of @-@ sight between the two towns .

 Napoleon had calculated that <unk> would withdraw toward Vienna , expecting reinforcements from Russia ; he envisioned that the armies would engage in a great battle at Vienna , and that this battle would decide the war . Consequently , Napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the Grande <unk> to create a new VIII Corps . This corps was to secure the north shore of the <unk> , block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from reinforcing one another and , more importantly , prevent <unk> from crossing the river and escaping to Russia . 
 The new VIII Corps , under the overall command of <unk> <unk> , included three infantry divisions and a division of cavalry ( see Order of Battle below ) . Corps <unk> , as it was known , crossed the <unk> at <unk> and <unk> in early November 1805 and marched east , on the north bank of the <unk> . Operating independently , the <unk> 's cavalry conducted reconnaissance ahead of them and on the flanks . Gen. <unk> 's division ( about 6 @,@ 000 men ) took the lead ; <unk> was with them . They were followed by Gen. <unk> 's division ( another 4 @,@ 000 ) about one day 's march behind . Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> 's division ( another 4 @,@ 000 ) , marching another day behind <unk> , brought up the rear . A flotilla of 50 boats acquired at <unk> provided communications across the <unk> . Before sending <unk> on his mission , Napoleon instructed him to protect his north flank at all times against possible Russian reinforcements , advice he reiterated in subsequent written orders . Napoleon also advised <unk> to secure all <unk> of the <unk> between <unk> and Vienna . 
 On 9 November <unk> 's division reached <unk> an der <unk> and covered the 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) to <unk> by early on the following afternoon . Here it <unk> with some Russian patrols to the east of the town and expelled them . Feeling confident , the French established a forward post just upstream from Stein . In <unk> itself <unk> set up his command post and directed the establishment of a small field hospital . Although the position seemed secure , he had ignored Napoleon 's strict instructions and neglected to protect his left ( north ) flank . 
 This failure was an important factor when <unk> lost his corps ' so @-@ called " eyes " : after he and <unk> had crossed the <unk> , the French <unk> had <unk> to the northwest , leaving only three squadrons of the 4th <unk> available for reconnaissance . These had left the division and were operating independently of <unk> 's command . Consequently , <unk> and <unk> marched <unk> through the narrow canyon west of <unk> , not knowing what lay ahead of them . <unk> had led the Coalition army across the <unk> at <unk> , a short distance past Stein , and destroyed the bridge behind him . His actions deprived the French commanders of a possible route across the <unk> , putting the deployment of the entire French division at further risk in the case of retreat . In this decision <unk> abandoned Vienna to the French , who were <unk> on the Austrian capital from the north , west and southwest , for the security of uniting with reinforcements from <unk> . <unk> chose a military solution over a political one . 
 Unknown to either <unk> or <unk> , the Coalition had concentrated a force of approximately 24 @,@ 000 men ( mostly Russians and a few Austrians ) within a few kilometers of the French position at <unk> . In comparison , <unk> 's division had only 6 @,@ 000 men . The Austro @-@ Russian force was a mixture of infantry , <unk> ( usually deployed as <unk> ) , Russian <unk> and Russian and Austrian cavalry , accompanied by more than 68 artillery pieces . <unk> , who had learned the military arts under the tutelage of the legendary Russian <unk> <unk> , had overall command . The Russian cavalry , units of the greatly feared Cossacks , were well @-@ suited for patrolling the river bank ; indeed , on 9 November they had taken 40 French soldiers as prisoners . Furthermore , reinforcements stood in Moravia , less than two weeks ' march away . If the main body of the French army crossed the river , they would require time to prepare . <unk> would have ample warning of any large @-@ scale French movement . 
 After the afternoon 's initial <unk> with the French , <unk> held a council of war on the evening of 10 November at <unk> , at the great <unk> there . He knew several things . First , he knew the positions of the French from prisoners his Cossacks had captured . He also knew that <unk> had crossed at <unk> and was well ahead of any French reinforcements : <unk> had crossed at <unk> and , by 10 November , stood at <unk> , 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) upstream , and <unk> was another 7 kilometers ( 4 mi ) further behind him . <unk> knew the size of the French <unk> division <unk> its positions , and he knew that most of the <unk> were not covering the French flank but had turned north . He also knew , or had made a good <unk> , about Napoleon 's orders , so he knew what to offer <unk> and <unk> as bait . 
 
 = = = Battle plan = = = 
 
 In addition to the Russian generals , the council included Austrian commanders Lieutenant Field Marshal Johann Heinrich von <unk> and Friedrich Karl Wilhelm , <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> , who had retired from the military in 1800 , had been recalled into service after the Ulm <unk> and had come to <unk> highly recommended by the Emperor . He was an experienced <unk> and strategist and had served in a variety of posts in the Habsburg military ; he had been <unk> Charles ' trusted adviser during the campaigns from 1796 to 1800 and had assisted in planning several of Charles ' victories . Upon his recall , <unk> was appointed Chief of the <unk> General Staff of the Coalition Army . The generals had found among the Austrian force one <unk> Christoph Freiherr von <unk> ( 1753 – 1824 ) , who had knowledge of the local geography . 
 Together , <unk> , <unk> and the other generals , with von <unk> 's advice on the local terrain , <unk> a plan to encircle the French at <unk> . Russian commander Mikhail <unk> <unk> would approach <unk> 's division from the east , supported by <unk> <unk> 's corps , and pin the French in place . Three additional columns , commanded by <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> Gen. <unk> and <unk> , would outflank the French from the west and the north . They would offer , as bait , a rumor : the Russian army was retreating into Moravia and only a rearguard would be left at <unk> . 
 
 = = Battle = = 
 
 On the night of 10 – 11 November a Russian column under <unk> 's command began its passage through the narrow canyons , intent on arriving at <unk> by noon ; two more columns , under <unk> and <unk> , moved in wider <unk> , planning to pass through the mountains and attack the French , who were extended along the river bank . According to the plan , in late morning <unk> 's column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a flanking assault on the French right . This flanking attack , combined with <unk> 's frontal assault from Stein , would force the French into a <unk> ; <unk> , they would have no option but to <unk> die . To ensure the success of the plan , the second and third columns , under <unk> and <unk> , would arrive in early and mid @-@ afternoon and support the earlier assaults . In this way , even if the French tried to retreat west to <unk> , they would not escape the <unk> @-@ like grip of the Coalition army . 
 <unk> accepted the bait of a <unk> Russian retreat . In the early morning of 11 November he and <unk> departed from <unk> to seize Stein and <unk> , <unk> the Russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear @-@ guard behind . As they approached Stein , a column of <unk> 's troops attacked the French forward positions . <unk> this force was the <unk> Russian rear guard , <unk> ordered Gen. <unk> to counterattack and push east towards the town of Stein . Fighting spread though the villages of <unk> , <unk> and the farm at <unk> . Instead of withdrawing , as a rear guard would , more and more Russian troops appeared and engaged the French column . 
 Initially <unk> made rapid progress , but he quickly recognized that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rear guard of a retreating army . Realizing he had been <unk> and that <unk> 's troops were tiring rapidly , <unk> sent orders to <unk> 's division to <unk> forward . By mid @-@ morning the French momentum had stalled ; <unk> committed most of his remaining forces to driving <unk> back , leaving a single <unk> 300 <unk> cover his northern flank , and sent the rest to attack the Russian right . Within 30 minutes he achieved the superiority of numbers he sought . His 4 @,@ 500 French opposed 2 @,@ 600 Russians and forced them back toward Stein while pressing an attack along the river . <unk> had no option , for neither <unk> 's nor <unk> 's flanking columns were to be seen . 
 At this stage of the battle fighting paused . <unk> and <unk> waited for <unk> 's arrival while <unk> and <unk> waited for <unk> 's and <unk> 's . <unk> 's column was expected to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance . The timing of the respite varies , depending on whose reports are consulted : fighting paused at around 12 : 00 or 14 : 00 . <unk> arrived first and immediately assaulted <unk> 's line with three battalions , pushing the French out of <unk> . Caught between two strong forces , <unk> attempted to push his way back through <unk> , to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops . <unk> through the narrow <unk> canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear , <unk> and his division were trapped when more of <unk> 's Russians appeared to block their retreat . The narrow <unk> hampered the Russians ; <unk> 's men had to march out of the canyons , form ranks and attack in waves . Despite <unk> 's continuous assault in the next two to three hours , <unk> and <unk> pushed the Russians back up the narrow <unk> in the hillside . At this point , <unk> 's column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle . The French were outnumbered more than three to one , assaulted in the front by <unk> 's column , in the middle by <unk> 's and in the rear by <unk> . 
 Earlier in the morning <unk> had proceeded with his column south and east along the river , from <unk> , according to instructions . Even before the arrival of <unk> 's <unk> , he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause . They came back to report that a Russian column ( <unk> 's ) was descending from the mountains to take the road to <unk> . Realizing this would separate him from the forward division , <unk> <unk> his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank . The French assault , heralded by cannon fire , caused <unk> 's troops to turn their attention from <unk> 's <unk> force to face these new <unk> . Although superior in numbers , <unk> 's column had no supporting artillery , and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size . It was <unk> 's turn to face attackers at his front and rear , until the arrival of <unk> 's column , which had <unk> its way through the mountains in the west . 
 <unk> arrived at dusk , and the action continued well after dark ; in mid @-@ November night falls at close to 17 : 00 in the upper <unk> <unk> . Despite the darkness , <unk> descended out of the <unk> and deployed his troops to <unk> <unk> 's flank . As his Russians entered the <unk> , they came between a battalion of French and another of Russians . With the additional force , the French were overwhelmed , but most of the shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend from <unk> in the dark . Under the cover of darkness , <unk> used the French flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank . The French and Russians continued to <unk> <unk> into the night as <unk> encountered one another in the dark . <unk> of <unk> 's force provided any necessary rear guard action , and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the <unk> , while they maintained possession of only <unk> and <unk> on the north bank .

 The losses were <unk> : <unk> lost close to 40 percent of his division to death and wounds . Aside from losing five guns , 47 officers and 895 men under his command were captured , bringing the loss of <unk> closer to 60 percent ; furthermore , he lost the eagles of the 4th Infantry Regiment ( France ) and the eagle and <unk> of the 4th <unk> . The Russians lost around 4 @,@ 000 , about 16 percent of their force , and two regimental colors . The Austrian Lieutenant Field Marshal <unk> was killed as the battle concluded , probably by Russian <unk> in the confused melee . The vineyards and the villages of <unk> and <unk> were destroyed , as was most of <unk> and Stein . <unk> was heavily damaged ; the French plundered the town at least twice , and " <unk> handled " its inhabitants .

 Both sides claimed victory . Although losses were fairly equal in terms of <unk> wounded or dead on each <unk> Coalition forces went into battle with 24 @,@ 000 men while the French started with <unk> 's division of about 6 @,@ 000 , which grew close to 8 @,@ 000 when <unk> 's men joined the fighting in the afternoon . Regardless , <unk> 's division was nearly destroyed ; the 30 percent losses experienced by the French fell predominantly on his division . <unk> for both sides , the fighting was hard . The weather had been cold ; an early storm had left slick icy mud in the roadways , and <unk> " like chandeliers " hung from the trees . 
 For the Coalition , the Russians were secure on the north bank of the <unk> , awaiting reinforcements from <unk> ; the bridges between <unk> and Vienna had been destroyed , making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult , but not impossible . After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news , the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory . The French had retreated from the field with a badly <unk> division and <unk> had secured the right flank . Indeed , Francis was so pleased with the outcome at <unk> that he awarded <unk> the Military Order of Maria <unk> . 
 For the French , the survival of the Corps <unk> seemed nothing short of a miracle . The remainder of <unk> 's division crossed the river the next morning and eventually <unk> in Vienna , which the French acquired by deception later in the month . More importantly for them , the French force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions . Initially there had been some panic and parts of at least one French battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft . They had lost control of the boats in the current and smashed into the pillars of the burned bridge at <unk> , <unk> their boats . <unk> into the icy river , most had drowned . Despite this initial panic , <unk> 's column retained its cohesion , and responded well to various difficult demands . <unk> had demonstrated his tactical <unk> : when he heard cannon fire , he directed his troops toward it to support the French division . In terms of French staffing , <unk> 's failure to guard his flank , especially in the face of Napoleon 's direct advice , adversely influenced his relationship with his commander . However , in the immediate weeks ahead , the flamboyant <unk> did more to annoy Napoleon than <unk> had . In assessing the battle and its aftermath , historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only on <unk> and <unk> : " Napoleon , aware of <unk> 's danger and his own <unk> for it , vented his frustration on <unk> , whom he unjustly accused of abandoning <unk> for the empty glory of riding through Vienna . " 
 After the victory at <unk> , Napoleon dispersed the VIII Corps and reassigned <unk> . However disappointed he may have been with <unk> , Napoleon was pleased with <unk> 's performance . As recognition of his conduct in what the French called " the immortal Battle of <unk> " , <unk> received the Officer 's Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor . 
 The loss of <unk> was a significant blow to the Austrian military organization . Called out of retirement for this specific task , he was one of their most experienced general staff officers , other than the <unk> Charles . From the summer of 1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been Chief of the <unk> General Staff of the Army , the Lower Rhine , the Rhine and the Army of Germany . Furthermore , he was a trusted member of <unk> Charles ' staff . He had helped to design several of Charles ' more important victories at <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> at <unk> and <unk> , the battles at <unk> and <unk> , and the northern Swiss Campaign of <unk> that included battles at <unk> and <unk> . An experienced officer and excellent <unk> , he might well have made a more effective Chief of the <unk> General Staff of the Coalition Army at the Battle of <unk> than his eventual replacement , Franz von <unk> . In <unk> 's absence <unk> , the architect of the Austrian catastrophe at <unk> in 1800 , was chosen to develop the general battle plan of Coalition action at <unk> . <unk> , undoubtedly a far better <unk> than <unk> , and possessed of superior training and mapping skills , would have developed a more realistic Coalition plan for <unk> . <unk> 's presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory , but it would have <unk> the magnitude of the Coalition 's losses ; <unk> was considered one of Napoleon 's finest <unk> . 
 In the broader picture , despite the important major naval engagements , the outcome of the War of the Third Coalition was determined on the Continent , predominantly in the two major land operations . In the Ulm campaign , the Habsburgs achieved some minor victories , such as <unk> 's at <unk> @-@ <unk> , but ultimately lost an entire army and an officer corps . The latter would not resume arms against France until formally exchanged . This condition crippled the Austrian military leadership and forced the recall of such pensioners as <unk> out of retirement . After the capitulation at Ulm , isolated portions of the Austrian military <unk> capture and joined with their Russian allies ; Michael von <unk> 's corps slipped out of the <unk> and joined <unk> 's force . A few other small forces refused to <unk> and seemingly melted into the Bavarian mountains and the <unk> forests , to reappear in Bohemia for <unk> . Sixteen hundred cavalry , including <unk> Ferdinand and Prince <unk> , broke out of Ulm before its capitulation . Maximilian , Count of <unk> , led his column back through the mountains into Austria , fighting rear guard actions against pursuing French forces at the <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> . These elusive units were insufficient to balance heavy losses at key battles in which the Austrians could not hold their own against the French . Between the Ulm capitulation and the Austrian and Russian defeat at <unk> , there were other minor achievements : a successful <unk> between the cavalry that escaped from Ulm and the French near the town of <unk> , the contested victory at <unk> , and another within days at <unk> . 
 The second determining event , the decisive French victory at the Battle of <unk> over the combined Russian and Austrian armies , forced the Austrian withdrawal from the Coalition . The subsequent Peace of <unk> , signed on 26 December 1805 , reinforced the earlier treaties of <unk> <unk> and <unk> . Furthermore , Austria ceded land to Napoleon 's German allies , and paid an indemnity of 40 million francs . Victory at <unk> also gave Napoleon the latitude to create a <unk> zone of German states between France and the states of Prussia , Russia , and Austria . These measures did not establish a lasting peace on the continent . Prussian worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806 , in which Austria did not participate .

 Until 1805 , <unk> was probably best known as the village in which crusader Richard the <unk> was held by Leopold V , Duke of Austria . In 1741 , during the War of the Austrian <unk> , several hundred local villagers had held off the French and Bavarian armies , intent on capturing Vienna , by painting drain pipes to look like cannons , and beating on drums , thus suggesting the presence of a large force . 
 After 1805 , the exploits of 40 @,@ 000 French , Russian , and Austrian soldiers excited the European imagination . General <unk> 's grave has never been found , but in 1811 a monument for him was erected at the Stein Tor , the gate leading from the old village of <unk> to the hamlet of Stein . The house in which Captain von <unk> lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle . In 1840 , a Spanish <unk> created an image of the battle , which was later expanded by English <unk> John <unk> . The image depicts the evacuation of French troops via the <unk> flotilla ( see <unk> image ) on a <unk> night . In fact , the moon was in its last quarter phase 48 hours later , and on 11 November probably did not provide as much light as depicted in the image . 
 In 1836 , Jean Antoine <unk> Fort ( French , 1793 – 1861 ) , a historical painter , created a <unk> of the battle , Combat de <unk> le 11 <unk> 1805 ( ( English ) Battle of <unk> of 11 November 1805 ) , which is in the <unk> collection at Versailles . 
 In the Russian novel War and Peace , Leo <unk> devoted several pages to the battle , its prelude , and its aftermath , and the delivery of its news to the Tsar by Prince Andrew . Between <unk> and <unk> , at the edge of the <unk> plain , stands the " Little Frenchman " memorial ( see image ) erected in 1905 to commemorate the battle ; it bears the names of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and others on a copper @-@ engraved plate .

 As <unk> and Big Show continued their rivalry , Kurt Angle returned from his neck surgery and he and <unk> began to form a more friendly rivalry , as the two were allies yet contenders for the title .

 <unk> continued to aggressively pursue the WWE title despite his friendship with Angle . Mr. McMahon found his way into the angle , at first <unk> <unk> , who had involved himself in McMahon 's rivalry with Zach <unk> , for losing to Angle . This all turned out to be a <unk> that came into focus on the August 7 , 2003 SmackDown ! in <unk> , British Columbia . That night , <unk> and McMahon were to face each other in a steel cage match with Angle as the special guest referee as per McMahon 's orders on the previous week 's program .

 = Constant k filter = 
 
 Constant k <unk> , also k @-@ type <unk> , are a type of electronic filter designed using the image method . They are the original and simplest <unk> produced by this methodology and consist of a ladder network of identical sections of passive components . Historically , they are the first <unk> that could approach the ideal filter frequency response to within any prescribed limit with the addition of a sufficient number of sections . However , they are rarely considered for a modern design , the principles behind them having been superseded by other methodologies which are more accurate in their prediction of filter response . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 Constant k <unk> were invented by George Campbell . He published his work in 1922 , but had clearly invented the <unk> some time before , as his colleague at AT & T Co , Otto <unk> , was already making improvements to the design at this time . Campbell 's <unk> were far superior to the simpler single element circuits that had been used previously . Campbell called his <unk> electric wave <unk> , but this term later came to mean any filter that passes waves of some frequencies but not others . Many new forms of wave filter were subsequently invented ; an early ( and important ) variation was the m @-@ derived filter by <unk> who coined the term constant k for the Campbell filter in order to distinguish them . 
 The great advantage Campbell 's <unk> had over the <unk> circuit and other simple <unk> of the time was that they could be designed for any desired degree of stop band rejection or <unk> of transition between pass band and stop band . It was only necessary to add more filter sections until the desired response was obtained . 
 The <unk> were designed by Campbell for the purpose of separating <unk> telephone channels on transmission lines , but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that . The design techniques used by Campbell have largely been superseded . However , the ladder <unk> used by Campbell with the constant k is still in use today with <unk> of modern filter designs such as the <unk> filter . Campbell gave constant k designs for low @-@ pass , high @-@ pass and band @-@ pass <unk> . Band @-@ stop and multiple band <unk> are also possible . 
 
 = = <unk> = = 
 
 Some of the <unk> terms and section terms used in this article are pictured in the diagram below . Image theory defines quantities in terms of an infinite cascade of two @-@ port sections , and in the case of the <unk> being discussed , an infinite ladder network of L @-@ sections . Here " L " should not be confused with the <unk> L – in electronic filter <unk> , " L " refers to the specific filter shape which resembles inverted letter " L " . 
 The sections of the hypothetical infinite filter are made of series elements having <unk> <unk> and <unk> elements with <unk> <unk> . The factor of two is introduced for mathematical convenience , since it is usual to work in terms of half @-@ sections where it disappears . The image <unk> of the input and output port of a section will generally not be the same . However , for a mid @-@ series section ( that is , a section from halfway through a series element to halfway through the next series element ) will have the same image <unk> on both ports due to symmetry . This image <unk> is designated <unk> due to the " T " <unk> of a mid @-@ series section . Likewise , the image <unk> of a mid @-@ <unk> section is designated <unk> due to the " <unk> " <unk> . Half of such a " T " or " <unk> " section is called a half @-@ section , which is also an L @-@ section but with half the element values of the full L @-@ section . The image <unk> of the half @-@ section is <unk> on the input and output ports : on the side presenting the series element it is equal to the mid @-@ series <unk> , but on the side presenting the <unk> element it is equal to the mid @-@ <unk> <unk> . There are thus two variant ways of using a half @-@ section . 
 Parts of this article or section rely on the reader 's knowledge of the complex <unk> representation of <unk> and <unk> and on knowledge of the frequency domain representation of signals . 
 
 = = <unk> = = 
 
 The building block of constant k <unk> is the half @-@ section " L " network , composed of a series <unk> Z , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> The " k " in " constant k " is the value given by , 
 <formula> 
 Thus , k will have units of <unk> , that is , <unk> . It is readily apparent that in order for k to be constant , Y must be the dual <unk> of Z. A physical interpretation of k can be given by observing that k is the limiting value of <unk> as the size of the section ( in terms of values of its components , such as <unk> , <unk> , etc . ) approaches zero , while keeping k at its initial value . Thus , k is the characteristic <unk> , <unk> , of the transmission line that would be formed by these <unk> small sections . It is also the image <unk> of the section at resonance , in the case of band @-@ pass <unk> , or at <unk> = 0 in the case of low @-@ pass <unk> . For example , the pictured low @-@ pass half @-@ section has 
 <formula> . 
 Elements L and C can be made <unk> small while retaining the same value of k . Z and Y however , are both approaching zero , and from the formulae ( below ) for image <unk> , 
 <formula> .

 The image <unk> of the section are given by 
 <formula> 
 and 
 <formula> 
 Given that the filter does not contain any <unk> elements , the image <unk> in the pass band of the filter is purely real and in the stop band it is purely imaginary . For example , for the pictured low @-@ pass half @-@ section , 
 <formula> 
 The transition occurs at a cut @-@ off frequency given by 
 <formula> 
 Below this frequency , the image <unk> is real , 
 <formula> 
 Above the cut @-@ off frequency the image <unk> is imaginary ,

 The transmission parameters for a general constant k half @-@ section are given by 
 <formula> 
 and for a chain of n half @-@ sections 
 <formula> 
 For the low @-@ pass L @-@ shape section , below the cut @-@ off frequency , the transmission parameters are given by 
 <formula> 
 That is , the transmission is <unk> in the pass @-@ band with only the phase of the signal changing . Above the cut @-@ off frequency , the transmission parameters are : 
 <formula> 
 
 = = = <unk> <unk> = = = 
 
 The presented plots of image <unk> , <unk> and phase change correspond to a low @-@ pass prototype filter section . The prototype has a cut @-@ off frequency of <unk> 
 = 1 <unk> / s and a nominal <unk> k = 
 1 <unk> . This is produced by a filter half @-@ section with <unk> L 
 = 1 <unk> and <unk> C = 
 1 <unk> . This prototype can be <unk> scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values . The low @-@ pass prototype can also be transformed into high @-@ pass , band @-@ pass or band @-@ stop types by application of suitable frequency <unk> . 
 
 = = <unk> sections = = 
 
 Several L @-@ shape half @-@ sections may be <unk> to form a composite filter . Like <unk> must always face like in these combinations . There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical L @-@ shaped half @-@ sections . Where a port of image <unk> <unk> faces another <unk> , the section is called a <unk> section . Where <unk> faces <unk> the section so formed is a T section . Further additions of half @-@ sections to either of these section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or <unk> elements . 
 It should be borne in mind that the characteristics of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image <unk> . This is usually not true of the sections at either end , which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance . The further the section is from the end of the filter , the more accurate the prediction will become , since the effects of the terminating <unk> are masked by the intervening sections .

 " The <unk> " is an episode of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , first broadcast on Christmas Day 2012 on BBC One . It is the eighth Christmas special since the show 's 2005 revival and the first to be within a series . It was written by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Saul <unk> . 
 The episode is set in the Victorian era and sees the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) brooding with the assistance of <unk> Madame <unk> ( Neve <unk> ) , her wife Jenny Flint ( <unk> Stewart ) and <unk> <unk> ( Dan <unk> ) , after the loss of companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams in the previous episode , " The Angels Take Manhattan " . He is forced out of hiding to investigate mysterious , sentient <unk> that are building themselves and meets <unk> Oswald ( Jenna @-@ Louise Coleman ) , a governess also investigating the <unk> . They discover that the <unk> are being animated by the Great Intelligence ( voice of Ian <unk> ) with the help of a man named Dr <unk> ( Richard E. Grant ) . 
 Building upon the character 's surprise introduction in " Asylum of the <unk> " , " The <unk> " introduces <unk> as the Doctor 's new companion , though ultimately it would be a third version of her character that would travel with the Doctor starting with " The Bells of Saint John " . In addition to <unk> , " The <unk> " also introduces a redesigned <unk> , revised title sequence and theme music , and sees changes to the Doctor 's costume . The special was produced in August 2012 , with location filming in Newport , Wales and Bristol . It received final ratings of 9 @.@ 87 million viewers in the UK , becoming the fourth most @-@ watched programme of Christmas Day . " The <unk> " was met with mostly positive reviews from critics , most of whom received the introduction and character of <unk> well . However , some felt that Grant and <unk> were <unk> as villains or the plot was slight because of the focus on characterisation .

 To promote the special , three <unk> were released . The first was broadcast during the 2012 Children in Need <unk> on 16 November 2012 , titled " The Great Detective " . The <unk> Madame <unk> , her human wife Jenny Flint , and the <unk> <unk> ( all returning from " A Good Man Goes to War " ) describe a number of strange phenomena to a shadowed fourth detective . The fourth detective reveals himself to be the Doctor , and tells the group that he has retired . 
 A second prequel , titled " <unk> <unk> " , was released online on 17 December 2012 . At the end of a case , <unk> and Jenny <unk> with an officer from Scotland Yard and <unk> for <unk> 's violent wishes for the <unk> 's punishment . <unk> explains <unk> 's alien origin as well as her own to the officer , much to his <unk> . <unk> reveals that she was <unk> by an extension to the London Underground and initially disliked humans , though that changed when she fell in love with Jenny . On the carriage ride home , Jenny notices it is beginning to snow and <unk> notes that the snow should be impossible because there are no clouds in the sky . 
 A third prequel , titled " The Battle of Demon 's Run — Two Days Later " was released on the United States iTunes and Amazon Video stores on 25 March 2013 . Two days after the events of " A Good Man Goes to War " , <unk> and Jenny convince <unk> that he is not mortally wounded and invite him to accompany them back to 1800s London . The scene had been filmed as an extra due to the anticipation that fans would ask how <unk> was resurrected and came to be in <unk> 's employ .

 In 1842 England , a young boy builds a <unk> , but refuses to play with the other children . The <unk> starts speaking to the boy , repeating his <unk> that the other children are silly . Fifty years later , the boy has grown up to be Dr. Walter <unk> , proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute . He hires men to collect samples of snow , which he places in a large snow @-@ filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated <unk> . The Doctor , still <unk> after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams , has parked his <unk> above Victorian London among the clouds . He uses his allies <unk> , Jenny , and <unk> to keep people away from him . They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city . 
 Elsewhere , <unk> <unk> <unk> Oswald investigates a disturbance outside the tavern she works at and finds the Doctor walking by . He attempts to leave discreetly , but <unk> follows him to a coach . Not wishing to become involved in matters , the Doctor instructs <unk> to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of <unk> 's memories with just a touch . Before they can do so , they are surrounded by <unk> created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group . The Doctor realises that <unk> 's thoughts are creating the <unk> and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting . <unk> <unk> the Doctor that if he <unk> her memory , she will forget how to deal with the <unk> . The Doctor <unk> allows her to go and <unk> a staircase to the sky to return to the <unk> . <unk> follows him and knocks on the door , but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers . <unk> returns to her other job as governess for the children of Captain <unk> . She learns that <unk> 's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead . <unk> realises that the pond that contains the old governess ' body is the only thing still frozen around them . She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny , who takes her to see <unk> . <unk> tells <unk> she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help . <unk> chooses the word " Pond " , which <unk> the Doctor and <unk> his interest . 
 Acting on a tip from <unk> , the Doctor visits the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes . He confronts Dr. <unk> and find a large glass globe in <unk> 's office that contains psychic snow . The Doctor speaks to the Great Intelligence , the entity that has been speaking to Dr. <unk> since he was a boy . He learns that the Great Intelligence has been controlling the <unk> and has taken interest in <unk> 's pond . The Doctor visits the pond and <unk> that the Great Intelligence is using the old governess ' body as a DNA <unk> to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt . While <unk> is putting the children to bed , the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house . The Doctor fights her off and is joined by <unk> , Jenny and <unk> . Dr. <unk> arrives with more <unk> and tells them he wants the governess ' ice body . The Doctor flees with <unk> to the roof of the mansion and then to the <unk> <unk> overhead . They are pursued by the ice governess , whom the Doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals . Inside the <unk> the Doctor gives <unk> a <unk> key , but the ice governess arrives and pulls <unk> down off the cloud . 
 The Doctor picks up <unk> and takes her back to <unk> 's mansion , placing her under medical care of <unk> . He collects the ice fragments from the governess and places them in a <unk> London Underground <unk> tin . He and <unk> travel to <unk> 's lab , where the Doctor notes the Intelligence 's plan to replace humanity with ice creatures and holds up the tin with the necessary DNA . Dr <unk> <unk> the tin and opens it only to find the memory worm , which <unk> on to him . The Doctor states that the Great Intelligence , which has been existing as a mirror of Dr <unk> 's thoughts , will vanish with the <unk> of <unk> 's memories . Instead , the Intelligence reveals that it existed long enough that it can now control <unk> 's body , which it uses to attack <unk> and the Doctor . The influence of the Great Intelligence quickly <unk> , and <unk> falls dead . Outside , a salt @-@ water rain has started , and the Doctor sees that another psychic ability has taken control of the snow from the Great Intelligence : the <unk> family , crying for <unk> . <unk> informs the Doctor upon his return to the <unk> mansion that <unk> only has moments left , and she passes away as the Doctor returns the <unk> key to her . At her funeral , the Doctor reads <unk> 's full name on her tombstone and realises she is the woman he met in " Asylum of the <unk> " who became a <unk> , whom he refers to as " <unk> Girl " . He <unk> announces that a person dying twice is an impossibility and , bidding farewell to his allies for now , the Doctor departs in the <unk> to investigate and find <unk> . The episode concludes in contemporary times , where a young woman resembling <unk> walks through the same graveyard , <unk> by <unk> 's tombstone .

 The Second Doctor previously encountered the Great Intelligence in the serials The <unk> <unk> ( 1967 ) , set in the 1930s , and The Web of Fear ( 1968 ) , set in the 1960s . In these stories , the Great Intelligence uses robot <unk> as its physical presence . The events of The Web of Fear are alluded to by the Doctor in " The <unk> " when he presents the London Underground <unk> tin to the Great Intelligence in Dr <unk> 's laboratory ; the Intelligence states , " I do not understand these markings " , in reference to the 1967 London Underground map design on the tin . The Doctor remarks that the Underground is a " key strategic weakness in metropolitan living " , referring to ( and possibly setting in motion ) the future <unk> attack on London via the Underground . 
 Coleman previously played <unk> Oswald in " Asylum of the <unk> " , though the connection between the two characters is not clarified until <unk> reveals she has an interest in <unk> , a trait that <unk> 's character also had . The Doctor , after meeting <unk> , <unk> replies " those were the days " when she asks why he isn 't staying to get acquainted with her , which are the same words he tells Craig <unk> ( " <unk> Time " ) when Craig comments that the Doctor always wins . The final scenes at the graveyard establish that <unk> shares the same name as <unk> , leading the Doctor to <unk> they are the same person . As seen on her gravestone , <unk> 's <unk> is 23 November , the date Doctor Who was first transmitted in 1963 .

 Writer Steven Moffat stated that he wanted an " epic " quality to the Christmas special . The story would also show how the Doctor had responded to losing his previous companions ; Moffat said that " I think he 's probably reached the point in his life where he 's saying , ' Friendship for me is just postponed <unk> — I want to be on my own for a while ' . " Moffat compared the withdrawn Doctor seen at the onset of the episode to the first appearances of the First Doctor ( William <unk> ) in 1963 and the <unk> Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) in 2005 . He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot proposed by Douglas Adams in the 1970s , but rejected by the production team at the time . Continuing the theme introduced with the series ' first five episodes , " The <unk> " was promoted like a movie . A movie poster was released in the Radio Times , showing the Doctor and <unk> ascending the ladder to the <unk> . 
 The episode saw several major design changes for the series . " The <unk> " is the debut of a redesigned <unk> interior , as well as a new title sequence and variation of the theme tune . The new title sequence features a brief glimpse of the Doctor 's face , the first time since Survival , the final serial of the classic series in 1989 , that the Doctor 's face has been seen in the title sequence . Moffat had noticed that the <unk> ' design was getting " progressively whimsical " and resembled more of a " magical place " rather than a machine . It was designed by series production designer Michael <unk> , who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be " darker and <unk> " and provide an easier access to the " gallery " of the ship when shooting . 
 The Doctor also wears a one @-@ off costume , Victorian @-@ themed , which Smith described as " a bit <unk> <unk> meets the Doctor " . Moffat described the new outfit as a " progression " as the Doctor was in " a different phase of his life now " and felt more " grown @-@ up " and <unk> . The costume was designed by Howard <unk> for this episode . " The <unk> " also contains several references to Sherlock Holmes , including the Doctor dressing up as him . Moffat is co @-@ creator of the BBC series Sherlock , for which Smith auditioned for the role of Doctor Watson before being cast as the Doctor . In addition , the incidental music during the scene bears a resemblance to the Sherlock theme . 
 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 
 This episode marks the return of Jenna @-@ Louise Coleman , who previously appeared in the series opener , " Asylum of the <unk> " . Coleman was cast because of her chemistry with Matt Smith , and especially because she was able to talk faster than him . She auditioned for the role of <unk> , not <unk> from " Asylum " , as the concept of the two characters being the same only occurred to Moffat whilst casting for <unk> . The production team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced screenings keep Coleman 's appearance a secret until " Asylum " was broadcast ; the effort was ultimately successful . Moffat stated that the introduction of a new companion made " the show feel different " and brought the story to " a new beginning " with a different person meeting the Doctor . Smith said that <unk> was different from her predecessor Amy Pond ( Karen <unk> ) , which allowed the audience to see a different side of the Doctor . Coleman described her as resourceful and not intimidated , citing the reason for following the Doctor at the beginning as pursuing answers . The <unk> who would become a travelling companion of the Doctor would not debut until the Spring premiere , " The Bells of Saint John " ; save for a brief cameo at the end of " The <unk> " . Coleman stated that she played each version as individuals with " trust that there would be a payoff " to her mystery . 
 Also returning to the series are Neve <unk> as Madame <unk> , Dan <unk> as <unk> and <unk> Stewart as Jenny . All three previously appeared in " A Good Man Goes to War " and reprised their roles both in this episode and in the <unk> . They returned due to the popularity of <unk> and Jenny ; Moffat considered a spin @-@ off featuring them , though he did not have the time to do it . Instead , he decided to bring them back in the main series . Richard E. Grant had previously played the Doctor on two occasions , as an alternative Tenth Doctor in the spoof charity special Doctor Who and the Curse of <unk> Death , which was written by Moffat and as an alternative <unk> Doctor in the animated story Scream of the <unk> which had been intended to be a continuation of the series before it was revived in 2005 . Smith commented that Grant was " born to be a Who villain . He pitches it on that perfect level and tone " . Grant 's appearance in Doctor Who was <unk> by the BBC via Twitter , announcing his appearance at midnight 5 August 2012 . Tom Ward was drawn to his role because of the quality of the script , and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared in the programme . The Great Intelligence was voiced by Sir Ian <unk> . The two children <unk> is governess to , <unk> and <unk> , were played by real @-@ life brother and sister Joseph and Ellie <unk> @-@ Alden . 
 
 = = = Filming and effects = = = 
 
 " The <unk> " was originally intended to be produced in the fourth production block of the series and be the first episode Coleman shot as her character ; however , it did not begin filming until the week of 6 August 2012 , after Coleman had worked on later episodes while Moffat was writing the Christmas special . The read @-@ through had taken place on 2 August 2012 . This was the first Christmas special to be filmed in BBC Wales ' new <unk> Lock studios . Scenes featuring Coleman and several guest stars in a Victorian setting were filmed in Newport , Wales , while Coleman and Smith were also spotted filming in Bristol two weeks later on 21 August . Some scenes which used snow props were filmed in Portland Square , Bristol , where filming took place overnight on 21 – 22 August 2012 . Bristol was chosen because it had Victorian @-@ era architecture . <unk> stated that his favourite set is the London Street with the back of the pub , which he said was based on a sixteenth @-@ century building in Oxford . The locations were blocked off and <unk> with fake snow . 
 The <unk> on the cloud was achieved through a mix of fog on the studio floor and post @-@ production special effects . Director Saul <unk> explained that it was difficult to achieve the desired look for the <unk> ; the first ones he likened to <unk> from Rainbow which was too " cute " of an appearance , and so the effects team created more menacing CGI faces . <unk> 's introduction to the <unk> introduced two novel effects for the show . The first was a single @-@ shot camera tracking from a few feet away from the <unk> to its interior , with the implication of the <unk> 's trans @-@ dimensional nature shown to the audience . In the following shot , the camera does a complete circle of the <unk> console , an effect not seen since the early days of the show . <unk> wanted to include this shot to further emphasize the " bigger on the inside than the outside " nature of the time machine . 
 In addition to the three prequel mini @-@ episodes , the cast also filmed an additional promotional video , " <unk> <unk> , " which the BBC uploaded during the days leading up to the broadcast . The video featured <unk> singing modified versions of several Christmas songs in character as <unk> as his <unk> look on , before everyone breaks character and begins laughing .

 The episode received mostly positive reviews . Dan Martin of The Guardian called it " actually the best Christmas Special since ' The Christmas Invasion ' " and the first to be " actually scary " , with " everything we like " about Doctor Who and Christmas . He praised Coleman 's introduction as <unk> and the gang of <unk> , Jenny , and <unk> . IGN 's Matt <unk> gave " The <unk> " a score of 9 @.@ 4 out of 10 , describing it as " a <unk> , <unk> <unk> in storytelling " which " refreshingly " lacked traditional Christmas references " in favour of some sparkling dialogue , gorgeous set design and fascinating characterisation " . While he felt that Grant and <unk> were <unk> , he was very positive towards Coleman 's " unpredictable " <unk> . Radio Times reviewer Patrick <unk> was pleased with the return of the Great Intelligence despite an inconsistency in the timeline he found , and praised the " lovely images " and direction of the special , though he felt the variation of the theme music " lacks the menace " of the original . While he was positive towards <unk> , he was " <unk> by her death " as it was " plainly silly " that she did not look injured . 
 Nick <unk> of <unk> gave the special four and a half out of five stars , writing that " the power of emotion saves the day again " was appropriate in light of the festivities and many <unk> referenced in the story . <unk> was positive towards the " terrific " comedy with <unk> , Coleman and the " surprisingly <unk> " Grant , as well as the new title sequence and <unk> . While he wrote that the subtle <unk> of the Great Intelligence was " a <unk> more interesting than the usual ' So , we meet again ! ' <unk> " , he ultimately felt their threat " never quite comes into sharp relief " . <unk> <unk> of The Independent wrote that " The <unk> " was stronger than the previous year 's " The Doctor , the Widow , and the <unk> " as it was connected to the overall story of the series , but " still has a way to go if it is to live up to ' A Christmas Carol ' " . Despite feeling that it was " enjoyable " , she noted that " the story feels truncated and rushed " 
 The Mirror 's Jon Cooper also praised Coleman and the new side of the Doctor that was shown , comparing it to Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) challenging the <unk> Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) . However , he felt the character @-@ heavy story was to the <unk> of the plot , which was " a classic Who set @-@ up that ultimately suffers from a lack of explanation [ and ] more set @-@ pieces than a coherent whole " . He felt that the episode may not have been accessible for casual viewers , but offered much for fans in time for the programme 's fiftieth anniversary . Dominic <unk> of The Daily Telegraph gave " The <unk> " three out of five stars , disappointed that it was not as scary as it had been <unk> to be .

 No. 20 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) support squadron . Coming under the control of No. 96 Wing , it is responsible for the management of the airfield at RAAF Base <unk> , South Australia . The squadron originated as a maritime patrol unit during World War II . <unk> in August 1941 , it operated <unk> <unk> and Short Empire flying boats from bases in New Guinea , Queensland and the Northern Territory , conducting search @-@ and @-@ rescue , mine @-@ laying , anti @-@ submarine and bombing missions against Japanese targets in the Pacific theatre . Following the conclusion of hostilities , the squadron was disbanded in March 1946 . It was reactivated as an airfield support squadron in April 2015 .

 No. 20 Squadron was formed at Port Moresby , New Guinea , on 1 August 1941 for a general reconnaissance role , under the command of Squadron Leader <unk> Gibson . Its establishment was six <unk> <unk> flying boats and 133 personnel , but only five aircraft ( all transferred from No. 11 Squadron ) and 55 personnel were available initially . The squadron conducted long @-@ range patrols between bases scattered around the islands to Australia 's north in conjunction with No. 11 Squadron . On 18 November , No. 20 Squadron 's Catalinas were augmented by two Short Empire flying boats transferred from No. 11 Squadron . 
 On 25 November 1941 , following the loss of <unk> Sydney , one of No. 20 Squadron 's Catalinas was despatched to Western Australia to join a No. 11 Squadron <unk> in search @-@ and @-@ rescue missions , but they found only oil <unk> . By the outbreak of war in the Pacific , No. 20 Squadron had a strength of six Catalinas and two Empire flying boats . Its personnel at the beginning of December numbered 14 officers and 118 men . The squadron undertook its first sortie of the Pacific War on 8 December ; a <unk> located three Japanese <unk> in the vicinity of Thursday Island , Queensland . Later in the month it commenced anti @-@ submarine patrols and , in January 1942 , bombing raids against Japanese bases . As the Japanese advanced into the South West Pacific , No. 20 Squadron was also responsible for evacuating white civilians from areas threatened by invasion . On 21 January , one of its Catalinas located the Japanese fleet steaming for Rabaul and signalled a warning to the town 's Australian defenders before being shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire ; it was the squadron 's first combat loss . 
 In the wake of the fall of Rabaul , the Catalinas of Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons became the RAAF 's only offensive weapon against the Japanese . Their raids on Rabaul did little to stem the Japanese advance , and in the following months Port Moresby itself was subjected to increasingly frequent attacks , which destroyed aircraft , facilities , and squadron records . In February 1942 , the Short <unk> operated by Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons were transferred to the newly formed No. 33 ( Transport ) Squadron . No. 20 Squadron lost two Catalinas during patrols on 4 and 6 May ; the nine crewmen of the first were later found to have been captured and beheaded ; the crew of the second were also captured and subsequently disappeared without trace . 
 In response to the threat of invasion at Port Moresby , Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons moved to Bowen , Queensland , on 7 May 1942 . They were soon attacking Japanese targets in Lae , <unk> and Rabaul . On 27 June , each squadron contributed an aircraft to a four @-@ hour raid over Lae and <unk> during which , as well as bombs , the RAAF crews dropped beer bottles to disrupt the enemy soldiers ' sleep — the sound they made falling through the air was , according to the official history , " something between a <unk> whistle and a scream " . By 1 July , No. 20 Squadron 's strength was six Catalinas and 175 personnel , out of a planned establishment of nine aircraft and 415 personnel . Its prime responsibility in early 1942 was maritime reconnaissance as far as New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , and New Caledonia ; the latter half of the year saw a greater focus on night bombing . Now comprising 252 officers and men , the squadron relocated to Cairns on 11 November 1942 . From Cairns it continued to conduct reconnaissance , anti @-@ submarine and occasional bombing operations over the waters around New Guinea . Between December 1942 and March 1943 , No. 20 Squadron 's aircraft flew a total of 9 @,@ <unk> hours and dropped 227 tons of bombs . The squadron 's role changed in June 1943 when it commenced mine @-@ laying operations over the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines , though it continued to make some bombing raids and supply drops . 
 In September 1944 , No. 20 Squadron became part of No. 76 Wing RAAF , along with Nos. 42 and 43 Squadrons , and moved to Darwin , Northern Territory . All three squadrons operated Catalinas , their primary purpose being mine @-@ laying . On the night of 30 September , a <unk> of No. 20 Squadron was shot down while attacking a ship at <unk> in the Dutch East Indies ; the loss was compounded by the fact that one of the <unk> of the mining campaign , Lieutenant Commander <unk> Carr of the Royal Australian Navy , was aboard the plane and was captured by the Japanese . Another of the squadron 's Catalinas went down on the night of 27 / 28 January 1945 , possibly in a cyclone over the Timor Sea , during the campaign to mine <unk> . In March , a detachment of four No. 20 Squadron aircraft , along with four from No. 43 Squadron , laid mines off the coast of southern China and <unk> as part of a No. 76 Wing offensive in this area ; these operations were conducted from <unk> Gulf in the Philippines . One of No. 20 Squadron 's Catalinas was lost on the night of 7 / 8 March , most likely owing to bad weather rather than enemy action . Three of the squadron 's aircraft mined the entrance to Hong Kong harbour on 8 April and , on 26 May , four of its Catalinas mined <unk> harbour in China , the <unk> north that any Australian aircraft infiltrated during the war in the Pacific . Three of its aircraft flew the RAAF 's last mine @-@ laying mission on 30 July . 
 No. 20 Squadron 's final wartime sortie was a patrol on 14 August 1945 . Following the end of the war , the squadron operated in the transport role and ferried Australian prisoners of war home from various locations in South East Asia . It relocated to RAAF Station <unk> , New South Wales , on 21 November . No. 20 Squadron flew its last mission , a transport flight to <unk> , on 21 January 1946 , and disbanded at <unk> on 27 March .

 No. 20 Squadron was reactivated on 1 April 2015 to support airfield operations at RAAF Base <unk> , South Australia . <unk> of nine <unk> personnel and one Australian Public Service member under the command of Squadron Leader Simon Bartlett , the squadron formed part of No. 96 Wing , a component of Combat Support Group ( <unk> ) . The airfield had previously been managed under the auspices of <unk> Operational Support Group , but a command @-@ and @-@ control review commissioned by the Chief of Air Force recommended that , in common with other RAAF airfields , it should be administered by <unk> . RAAF Base <unk> , incorporating <unk> Village , was one of two Air Force units formally established on 12 January 2015 as part of a reorganisation of the <unk> Range Complex , the other unit being RAAF <unk> Test Range . 
 The design of the reactivated squadron 's crest includes a wedge @-@ tailed eagle to denote courage and nobility , a <unk> spear <unk> to symbolise the town and its indigenous heritage , Sturt 's Desert <unk> to represent South Australia , and the <unk> star cluster , which features in the folklore of the local <unk> people . 
 
 
 = Light Tank Mk VII <unk> = 
 
 The Light Tank Mk VII ( <unk> ) , also known as the <unk> , was a British light tank produced by Vickers @-@ <unk> in the late 1930s and deployed during the World War II . The <unk> was originally designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the company for the British Army . It improved upon its predecessor , the Mk <unk> Light Tank , by introducing the extra firepower of a 2 @-@ pounder gun . The War Office ordered 70 tanks , an order that eventually increased to 220 . Production was delayed by several factors , and as a consequence , only 100 to 177 of the tanks were produced . 
 The tank 's design flaws , combined with the decision by the War Office not to use light tanks in British armoured divisions , ruled out the use of <unk> in the North African Campaign . As a result , the majority of the tanks remained in Britain , although 20 were sent to the USSR as part of the <unk> @-@ <unk> program . In early 1941 , the Royal Armoured Corps formed three squadrons for use in overseas amphibious operations , one of which was equipped with <unk> . In May 1942 , a small number of <unk> formed part of the British force which participated in the invasion of Madagascar , and , in June 1942 , <unk> were attached to the 1st Airborne Division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air @-@ portable light tank to support British airborne forces . The <unk> were transported and landed in specially designed General Aircraft <unk> gliders . A lack of gliders prevented their participation in the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 ; instead they were attached to the new 6th Airborne Division and became part of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment . 
 The division used approximately 20 <unk> during the British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944 . The tanks were successfully landed by glider , but they did not perform well . Several were lost in accidents , and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the German forces . A few days after the beginning of the operation , the tanks were removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support . By August 1944 , most of the <unk> in action were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks , and the remainder were replaced by the <unk> <unk> in December 1944 . 
 <unk> did not see any further combat and were deemed obsolete by 1946 ; the last was retired in 1950 . There were several variations on the <unk> design , including the <unk> self @-@ propelled gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII , but none of these were ever used in active service with the British Army .

 = = = Initial development = = = 
 
 The prototype of the Light Tank Mk VII ( <unk> ) , nicknamed ' <unk> ' , was first developed in 1937 by Vickers @-@ <unk> as a private venture , and was intended to be sold either to the British Army or to foreign militaries . It was to be the latest in a series of light tanks produced by the company . The tank was designed to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns . Vickers @-@ Armstrong installed on the Mk <unk> a 2 @-@ pounder 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) main gun paired with a 7 @.@ 92 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 312 in ) <unk> machine gun , and mounted the two guns in a two @-@ man turret . The tank possessed a maximum of 14 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 55 in ) of armour . The prototype weighed approximately 16 @,@ 800 pounds ( 7 @,@ 600 kg ) and was powered by a 165 @-@ horsepower ( 123 kW ) Meadows engine . <unk> was on eight road wheels , four per side , with no separate driver or <unk> wheels and it was capable of a 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) top speed . The Mk VII design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated into earlier Vickers models . The front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns by <unk> the tracks . For sharper turns , the system returned to the conventional method of <unk> one track to turn the tank ; the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on the <unk> and reduce its power <unk> . The suspension system was also a new design that relied on struts with pockets of air for <unk> and <unk> of oil for <unk> , and each of the wheels was independently sprung . 
 The War Office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during May and June 1938 ; the model was tested as a possible " light cruiser " since War Office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor , the Mark VI . The War Office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the <unk> <unk> offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance . Despite this , it was decided that it was essential for some <unk> to be produced , and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program . Accordingly , the War Office gave the <unk> the official General Staff specification number <unk> , and , in November 1938 , accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an external fuel tank to increase the tank 's range . 
 
 = = = Production = = = 
 
 The number to be produced was subject to <unk> as the War Office <unk> in their demand ; in July 1938 , it requested that 70 of the tanks be produced , then increased the request to 120 after a three @-@ day conference in November . Production was to begin in July 1940 , but meanwhile the War Office temporarily returned to its original order of 70 before increasing the number to 100 . The number further increased to 220 after Metropolitan <unk> Carriage and <unk> , a company part owned by Vickers @-@ Armstrong that would be producing the tanks , indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tanks . 
 Production of the tank was delayed by a number of factors . The War Office put their order on hold in a post @-@ Battle of France decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks , due to the poor performance of British light tanks during that battle . Due to the shortage of more suitable tanks , light tanks that were not designed for use against German armour , were nevertheless deployed against them ; the resulting high casualties led the War Office to re @-@ evaluate the suitability of the light tank design . The pre @-@ war role of the light tank , that of reconnaissance , meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross @-@ country abilities . Further delays were caused by the bombing raids of the Luftwaffe during May 1941 against the factories where the tanks were assembled . 
 The cumulative effect of these delays resulted in the production of only a small number of Mk <unk> ; estimates place the final total produced to be between 100 and 177 . The name ' <unk> ' was given to the Mk VII , on 22 September 1941 , on the orders of the War Office . The last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of 1942 and delivered at the end of the year . 
 
 = = = Transfer to airborne role = = = 
 
 The War Office and the Army were concluding , at this point , that light tanks were a liability and too vulnerable for use in further combat , and the <unk> was considered to be obsolete . This decision may have marked the end for the <unk> in active service ; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense North African heat . 
 The demise of <unk> was prevented by a decision made by the War Office in mid @-@ 1941 , as it was considering the equipment to be used by Britain 's fledgling airborne forces , formed in June 1940 under the orders of the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill . When selecting the equipment for the airborne forces , officials at the War Office concluded that gliders would be an integral component ; gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment , which , by 1941 , was to include artillery and some form of tank . Plans to transport a tank went through a number of revisions , but , by May 1941 , the feasibility of a 5 @.@ 5 metric tons ( 5 @.@ 4 long tons ) tank to be carried for 350 miles ( 560 km ) in a glider was accepted , although the aircraft would have to be specifically designed for the task . In a conference held on 16 January 1941 , it was decided that the General Aircraft <unk> , currently under development , would be used to transport a single <unk> tank or two Universal <unk> . The <unk> was chosen because it was an obsolete design , and was therefore available to be used by the airborne forces . 
 Beginning in January 1944 , training exercises were conducted carrying the <unk> and their crews inside <unk> gliders . These exercises were successful ; during the training by ' C ' Squadron of the <unk> Pilot Regiment , which specialised in flying the <unk> , over 2 @,@ 800 <unk> were made with an average of 50 <unk> per crew . Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries , with seven pilots killed during the training . When the <unk> was re @-@ designated as an airborne tank , several changes were made to its design . A number of tanks had their 2 pounder guns replaced with a 76 @.@ 2 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 00 in ) infantry support howitzer ; these tanks were then designated as <unk> 1 <unk> ( Close Support ) . Additionally , <unk> <unk> were added to those <unk> which still possessed their 2 pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour penetration . 
 The <unk> experienced several setbacks throughout its development and deployment with the Army and airborne forces . One of the major problems was the limited number of these tanks that existed after production ended in 1942 , which particularly affected the airborne forces . The transport of 20 of the tanks to the USSR under the <unk> @-@ <unk> Act depleted the number available for use by airborne forces , as did the loss of several more during Operation <unk> , the invasion of Madagascar . A Royal Armoured Corps report issued in December 1942 stated that approximately 50 <unk> were available for use . In a memorandum , dated January 1943 , by Major General George F. <unk> , commander of the 1st Airborne Division , <unk> complained that he had been informed that 70 of the tanks were available , whereas only 50 actually remained , with no reserves to replace those lost in combat . This lack of sufficient replacement reserves , combined with a War Office report that some <unk> airborne tanks would be required for the 1st Airborne Division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed in India , led to the <unk> 's eventual replacement by the US <unk> <unk> . 
 
 = = Performance = = 
 
 A number of design faults of the <unk> were revealed through its operational use . Its size limited the possible crew to three , a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret , resulting in too few crew members to operate the <unk> effectively . The gunner or commander , in addition to his own duties , had to act as <unk> for the 2 pounder , which caused delays in combat . A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank , controlling a troop of <unk> during combat would be almost impossible . 
 Problems were also found with the <unk> <unk> fitted to the 2 @-@ pounder to increase its range and penetration power ; after they had been fitted the <unk> could not be removed , and could only fire specially designed armour @-@ piercing rounds , which took time to manufacture . 
 The War Office also considered the <unk> 's cooling system faulty , making the tank unsuitable for service in <unk> climates , such as the Middle East and North Africa .

 The first <unk> were delivered to the Army in November 1940 , and were initially deployed with the 1st Armoured Division ( which was being refitted after losing the majority of its previous tanks during the Battle of France ) and the newly formed 6th Armoured Division . However , the faults discovered with the <unk> cooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the Middle East to participate in the North African Campaign . Shortly after , all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of British armoured divisions as not suitable for further service . 
 The <unk> remained in Britain , and would probably have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service , but on 22 June 1941 the German invasion of the USSR , Operation Barbarossa began , and the USSR became an ally of Britain . The <unk> @-@ <unk> program , begun in March 1941 by the United States of America to supply defensive materials to Britain and China , was therefore extended to the USSR . As part of the program , the British government began supplying war materials to the USSR , which in early 1942 , included a shipment of 20 <unk> , as well as a number of Valentine and Matilda Mk I Infantry tanks . The Soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the British , and so could use the <unk> . When the tanks arrived in the USSR , however , it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions ; additionally , the cold weather had a <unk> effect on the tank 's suspension and tracks . Additional testing of the <unk> was conducted by the Soviet military and the design was admired for its <unk> , <unk> , and speed , as well its ability to run on low @-@ quality fuel , unlike contemporary Soviet designs . The <unk> of the <unk> 's armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved , as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank 's speed . Despite these drawbacks in the <unk> 's design , Soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the T @-@ 70 light tank in use at the time , and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat . A number of <unk> were sent to Tank Training Schools which were subsequently sent into battle , and in September 1943 two were assigned to the <unk> <unk> Tank Battalion , which was attached to the 5th Guards Tank Brigade ; both tanks were destroyed in combat , one on 30 September and the other on 2 October , the latter a casualty of artillery fire . Several were also used for propaganda purposes , appearing in photographs of Soviet troops who were fighting in the <unk> region .

 In mid @-@ 1941 , the Royal Armoured Corps in Britain created three tank squadrons for special overseas operations , known as ' A ' , ' B ' and ' C ' Special Service Squadrons . Both ' A ' and ' B ' Squadrons were equipped with Valentine Infantry tanks and Mark <unk> light tanks , but ' C ' Squadron was equipped with twelve <unk> transferred from the 2nd Armoured Brigade , 1st Armoured Division . On 31 July 1941 , ' C ' Squadron was officially activated and immediately received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside ' A ' and ' B ' Squadrons in an unspecified tropical climate . All three squadrons were transported to <unk> in Scotland for intensive training that focused on embarkation and <unk> from ships and landing craft to prepare them for action in potential amphibious operations . In early September , elements of ' C ' Squadron , including six <unk> , formed part of a force which sailed for Freetown in West Africa ; during this period of the war there were fears that the Spanish government might enter the conflict on the side of Germany , and the force was <unk> to capture a number of Spanish islands off the coast of Africa if this occurred . These fears proved <unk> , and in March 1942 , the unit returned to Britain to join the rest of the squadron in training . 
 The next assignment , Operation <unk> , was the invasion of Madagascar , the third largest island in the world and then under <unk> French control . The Prime Minister and the Combined Chiefs of Staff decided that Madagascar should be occupied as rapidly as possible to deny the port of <unk> to Japanese naval forces , which had recently advanced into the Indian Ocean . Operation <unk> was under the command of Major General Robert G. <unk> and consisted of No. 5 Commando , 29th Independent Brigade Group , and the 17th and 13th brigade groups from 5th Infantry Division . The 29th Brigade formed the core of the invasion force due to its training in amphibious operations , and under its command was ' B ' Special Service Squadron , created by <unk> six <unk> from ' B ' Squadron and six <unk> from ' C ' Squadron into a single unit . The squadron was formed into four troops , one Headquarters troop of three <unk> and one <unk> , one of four <unk> , and two formed from the remaining five <unk> . The invasion force assembled off the west coast of the northern tip of Madagascar on 4 May , near <unk> and the bay of Diego <unk> . The invasion plan called for an amphibious assault landing on four beaches on the west side of the tip , which would allow the British forces to advance approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) and approach <unk> from the rear . Information about the landing beaches , the defences possessed by the port , and the <unk> French defending forces was limited and vague , although it was believed that the defenders had no weapons capable of penetrating the armour of a Valentine tank . 
 The landings began at 04 : 30 on 5 May , with 5 Commando landing at <unk> Bay and the three infantry brigades and ' B ' Squadron landing at <unk> Bay . The objective of the infantry brigades and their armoured support was to take control of <unk> and a nearby town , but although the infantry landed successfully , ' B ' Squadron had more trouble ; the area of beach designated for its landing craft was blocked for several hours after a <unk> came loose from a landing craft and became stuck in the sand . The infantry brigades advanced toward <unk> without the squadron , but eventually two <unk> and a single <unk> were dispatched in support , catching up with the lead elements of the infantry near the town of <unk> . Here the invasion force encountered the first French defences , consisting of camouflaged trenches and <unk> dug in along a ridge . The tanks attempted to breach them , but the rocky ground made <unk> difficult and they could not close with the <unk> and trenches ; they engaged a number of targets with 2 pounder and machine @-@ gun fire , but the line had to be cleared by an infantry assault later in the day . The tanks were ordered to outflank the defences and advance further into the island , and they were soon joined by two other <unk> dispatched from the beaches ; the small force continued to advance until it encountered the <unk> French main line of defence . This had been built prior to the First World War and included camouflaged <unk> , machine @-@ gun nests and dug @-@ in 75 mm artillery pieces ; the latter , although not specifically designed for an anti @-@ tank role , could penetrate the armour of both the <unk> and the <unk> . The two <unk> advanced first but were knocked out by artillery fire , and two <unk> that were moving behind them suffered the same fate ; the third <unk> retreated in order to report on the French resistance , machine <unk> a motorcycle combination and a truck it encountered on the way back . 
 The commander of the <unk> made his report , and was then ordered to take command of four <unk> and two <unk> which had recently arrived and once again attempt to breach the French defences . The tanks followed the road leading to the defensive line and then attempted to out @-@ flank the line by advancing from the right @-@ hand side , using several hills as cover ; the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault , however , and one Valentine and one <unk> were hit and destroyed . The remaining tanks exchanged several <unk> of fire with the artillery pieces before retreating back to their original positions . The French line was eventually broken by 29th Brigade , aided by an amphibious assault by Royal Marines ; the remaining tanks of ' B ' Squadron , two <unk> and three <unk> , remained in defensive positions until the afternoon of 6 May , coming under sporadic artillery fire which disabled another Valentine . The squadron played no further part in the battle , as the <unk> French authorities negotiated a formal surrender the following day , although French troops would continue to engage the British occupying force in guerrilla warfare until late November . ' C ' Squadron suffered heavy casualties during the invasion ; only one Valentine and three <unk> out of twelve tanks were functional by 7 May , and the squadron had suffered seven killed and six wounded . It remained in Madagascar until early 1943 , when it was shipped to India and took part in the Burma Campaign as part of 29th Brigade .

 Because of a lack of equipment training facilities in mid @-@ 1940 , when the British airborne establishment was formed , the War Office was able to accept only 500 volunteers for training as airborne troops . Progress in setting up proper training facilities and acquiring suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first British airborne operation , Operation <unk> , was conducted by a <unk> Commando unit . By 1942 , there existed specifically trained airborne units , including the 1st Airborne Division , and on 19 January 1942 the War Office decided that a light tank unit would be one of the support units attached to the division . This unit , designated the Light Tank Squadron , was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division , using their tanks ' speed to capture objectives and then holding them until relieved by other units . The obvious unit for conversion was ' C ' Special Services Squadron , as it was trained to act as an independent tank unit and , more importantly , was the only unit that was still using <unk> ; it had been re @-@ designated as an airborne tank by the War Office . ' C ' Squadron was officially transferred to the 1st Airborne Division on 24 June 1942 , bringing with it seven <unk> among its other vehicles . The unit immediately began training , but was not attached to the 1st Airborne Division for long ; during mid @-@ 1943 , the division was transported to the Middle East so it could participate in the Allied invasion of Sicily . ' C ' Squadron remained in Britain , as not enough <unk> gliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its <unk> ; the squadron was transferred to the 6th Airborne Division , which had been raised in April 1943 , and ' C ' Squadron remained with it for the rest of the conflict . The squadron continued to train as an air @-@ portable unit , and participated in a number of exercises to prepare for its new duties , including reconnaissance of enemy positions and counter @-@ attacking enemy infantry and armour . 
 On 13 December 1943 , the War Office decided to expand the squadron into a regiment equipped with a combination of light tanks and conventional reconnaissance vehicles such as scout cars , and on 1 April 1944 , it was re @-@ designated as the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment . The regiment consisted of a Headquarters Squadron , a Light Tank Squadron and a Reconnaissance Squadron ; two <unk> , the Mark 1 <unk> variation , were attached to the Headquarters Squadron , but the Light Tank Squadron , also known as ' A ' Squadron , received the majority of the <unk> . ' A ' Squadron had approximately nineteen <unk> split between six troops , two of which were of the <unk> variation and the rest were armed with 2 pounders fitted with <unk> <unk> . On 24 May 1944 , after participating in a further series of exercises and manoeuvres , ' A ' Squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp at <unk> <unk> airfield , while the rest of the regiment moved to RAF <unk> Norton airfield the next day ; from these two airfields , the regiment would be transported from to participate in the British airborne landings in Normandy . The operation began on the night of 5 June , with the deployment of 6th Airborne Division to eastern Normandy . It was tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the Allied <unk> landings , securing strategically important areas east of Caen , capturing several important bridges over the Caen Canal and River <unk> , and destroying a coastal artillery battery . <unk> transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division 's brigades simultaneously ; one would have to be landed in a second lift later in the day . Major General Richard Gale had initially intended for the 6th <unk> Brigade , to which the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment was attached , to be landed first ; however , aerial photography revealed that anti @-@ glider poles had been erected in the landing zone selected for the brigade . Therefore , Gale decided that the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade ( which did not <unk> gliders ) should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones , allowing the 6th <unk> Brigade to land in the second lift . 
 The <unk> and <unk> gliders of the brigade landed at 21 : 00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter @-@ attack . The <unk> of ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the <unk> broke loose of its <unk> and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the <unk> they carried ; a third <unk> hit another <unk> as it was being <unk> and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their <unk> , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding <unk> . 
 The squadron retrieved all of the remaining <unk> and advanced to the south of the landing zone to link up with the rest of the regiment ; there , they received orders to support the 8th Parachute Battalion in the <unk> de <unk> area and conduct reconnaissance duties . After linking with the battalion , the squadron began <unk> , and engaged German infantry and armour they encountered . By the end of 7 June , two <unk> had been lost to enemy action , one destroyed by a German self @-@ propelled gun and the second by hitting a mine . The division was reinforced by British troops who were advancing from the invasion beaches and it began to push through Normandy , while the squadron continued its reconnaissance duties . At this time , Gale decided to avoid , when possible , engaging the <unk> with German armour , as they proved to be completely <unk> by the German tanks and self @-@ propelled guns , such as the Panzer IV and the <unk> III . Instead , when the division required armoured support , it summoned it from armoured units outside the division , and the <unk> were used to support infantry patrols and provide fire support . By August , in the division 's preparation for the planned breakout from the Normandy bridgehead , the majority of <unk> in ' A ' Squadron were replaced with Cromwell fast cruiser tanks ; only three <unk> remained , assigned to the Headquarters troop of ' A ' Squadron .

 Operation Tonga was the last that <unk> saw of active combat . During the first week of October 1944 , the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment underwent an extensive <unk> , in which it was completely <unk> , and all the remaining <unk> were retired . They were replaced with the <unk> <unk> , a purpose @-@ built airborne light tank of American design ; eight <unk> were used by the regiment in March 1945 during Operation <unk> , the airborne operation to cross the river Rhine . A report issued by the Director ( Air ) of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that the <unk> design was considered obsolete , and any light tanks used in post @-@ war airborne formations would be entirely new in design . A small number of <unk> remained in service with the 3rd Hussars until 1949 ; a <unk> glider flight was stationed at RAF <unk> , and a troop of <unk> was kept by the regiment for training exercises with the gliders . However , glider training by the regiment was stopped in 1950 and the <unk> withdrawn from service .

 There were several variants of the <unk> design . The first was the Light Tank Mk VIII , Vickers @-@ Armstrong 's proposed successor to the <unk> . The Mark VIII was also known as the Harry Hopkins , named after President Roosevelt 's chief diplomatic advisor , and was given the General Staff design number <unk> by the War Office . The Mark VIII was intended to improve upon the design of the <unk> in a number of areas . It had thicker armour than the <unk> , with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of 38 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) and the side armour to 17 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 67 in ) , and the turret and hull given more sloped surfaces to help <unk> shells fired at the tank . The dimensions of the <unk> were also changed ; the Mark VIII was longer by 6 inches ( 0 @.@ 15 m ) , wider by 1 foot 3 inches ( 0 @.@ 38 m ) and heavier . The new tank was no longer air @-@ portable , as it was too heavy to be carried by a <unk> . The 12 @-@ cylinder engine of the <unk> was fitted to the Mark VIII , although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to 30 miles per hour ( 48 km / h ) ; its armament also remained the same as that of the <unk> . The War Office authorised the construction of three prototype models in April 1941 . The new design was considered a success , and the Tank Board of the War Office ordered 1 @,@ 000 to be constructed in September . However , problems were encountered with further tests of the prototypes , and a report issued in December 1942 stated that production of the Mark VIII had been delayed due to developmental problems . These problems continued to persist into 1943 , when the War Office decided against using the tank in active service ; approximately 100 Mark <unk> were produced by 1945 , when production ended . 
 A second variant on the <unk> design was the <unk> <unk> Drive ( " <unk> DD " ) . The <unk> Drive system was invented by Nicholas <unk> , and was designed to allow a tank to ' swim ' through water and participate in amphibious operations . The system functioned by <unk> a large <unk> canvas screen around the tank above its tracks , which was supported by thirty @-@ six <unk> tubes and steel struts ; this gave the tank sufficient <unk> to float , and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank 's engine . The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land . The system was fitted during June 1941 , as the <unk> was the lightest light tank available at the time ; the converted tank was successfully tested on a number of lakes and reservoirs , allowing the <unk> Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks , such as the Valentine . The system would be used during Operation <unk> , when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches .

 <unk> , known in Japan as I Love Donald Duck : Georgia <unk> no <unk> ( Japanese : <unk> <unk> , Hepburn : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk> ) , is a 1991 <unk> video game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis . The game was released in Europe in 1991 , in North America on December 19 , 1991 and in Japan on December 20 , 1991 . <unk> stars Donald Duck and his three nephews , Huey , <unk> , and <unk> , as treasure @-@ hunters , and is part of a series of games published by Sega that were based on Walt Disney cartoon characters . 
 <unk> was released to mostly positive reviews from video game journalists . The game was universally lauded for its graphics , with magazines like Sega Pro describing them as " some of the best graphics around . " The game was also praised for its music and puzzles , as well as their clever use in the game . However , <unk> was criticized for its controls , being described by IGN as " float @-@ y " and making certain segments of the game <unk> difficult . The game was also criticized for its lack of difficulty overall as well as its lack of speech samples , which several other Genesis games of the time had .

 The player , as Donald , ventures through a variety of side @-@ scrolling levels . Generally , each level is divided into an overland part and a dungeon , such as the <unk> 's palace or the temple in which the Great Duck Treasure resides . Although the player may choose any order to play the overland sections , various obstacles prevent the player from entering the <unk> outside of a specific order . In addition to this , some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress in later sections . Once Donald has completed the overland section of an area , he may leave by calling his nephews ' biplane , and will return to the dungeon entrance of that area if the player chooses to return . 
 Donald is armed with a special gun that can shoot <unk> , popcorn or bubble gum . Donald has unlimited <unk> which can only temporarily <unk> enemies ( though bosses can still be damaged with <unk> ) , and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from <unk> <unk> . Later in the game , the <unk> is upgraded to act as a temporary platform to climb walls with and , when stuck to a passing bird , allows Donald to traverse longer distances . In <unk> , India and Egypt , Donald can also pick up <unk> <unk> which increase his temper , eventually temporarily allowing him to become <unk> , increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path .

 While Donald is <unk> through some books in <unk> <unk> 's library , a map falls out of a book relating to the treasure of King <unk> , ruler of the Great Duck Kingdom in ancient times . The map leads to the location of the king 's most prized possession , hidden in a secret place shortly before his death . Donald thinks this is his path to riches . Unfortunately Big Bad Pete <unk> and pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure . 
 <unk> with his nephews Huey , <unk> , and <unk> , and using the partial map from the library , Donald begins his search in <unk> , with the trail being directed to an Aztec pyramid in Mexico . Outside the pyramid , he is directed by a " sweet <unk> " to obtain a " hero key " from an explorer back in <unk> to open the pyramid . Inside the pyramid , Donald meets <unk> , who gives him a strange note and a <unk> to help him reach higher places , and tells him that <unk> <unk> is looking for him back in <unk> . Travelling across the <unk> of <unk> to meet <unk> , Donald is given <unk> 's latest invention , <unk> <unk> that can break through walls . The last location on the partial map is Count <unk> 's castle in Transylvania , where Donald encounters a ghost who tells him that the Count carries the real treasure map . 
 After defeating <unk> , Donald receives a more complete map . In India , Donald enters the palace of the <unk> , where she challenges him to defeat the tiger in her garden in exchange for a <unk> <unk> . Donald succeeds and receives the <unk> <unk> , which is the key to open a temple in Egypt . Donald is able to solve the " <unk> of the <unk> " using the note <unk> had given him , and obtains the <unk> of Ra before escaping in a mine cart . From there , he journeys to the South Pole , where he finds a key frozen in ice , and uses the <unk> of Ra to melt the ice and grab the key . The key unlocks the hold of a Viking ship , which contains an ancient diary with the secret to locating the treasure . The ship is haunted by ghosts , and the Viking captain sends Donald below decks to get rid of them . After defeating a skeletal Viking warrior , Donald returns to the deck , where the captain informs him that the diary is hidden in ice near the South Pole , and gives him an " ancient Viking <unk> " that <unk> to flying creatures . Donald then returns to the South Pole , <unk> a ride on one of Pete 's bird <unk> to reach the diary . 
 However , upon finding the diary , Pete shows up , holding Donald 's nephews hostage in exchange for the diary . After giving Pete the diary , Donald travels to Pete 's hideout to defeat Pete and get the diary back . The diary reveals that the map , when dipped in water , will reveal the location of the Great Duck Treasure . Donald flies to the island where the treasure is hidden and manages to evade its traps in order to reach the treasure vault . After defeating the ancient spirit guarding the treasure , Donald opens the vault only to find a simple stone statue . When the disappointed Donald returns home , Huey , <unk> and <unk> accidentally break the statue , which reveals a golden <unk> necklace was hidden inside . Donald gives the necklace to Daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together .

 The <unk> colossal heads are at least seventeen monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders . The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of the <unk> civilization of ancient <unk> . All portray mature men with <unk> <unk> , flat <unk> , and slightly crossed eyes ; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of <unk> and Veracruz . The backs of the monuments often are flat . The boulders were brought from the Sierra de los <unk> mountains of Veracruz . Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances , requiring a great deal of human effort and resources , it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual <unk> rulers . Each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress . The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major <unk> centres , but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear . 
 The discovery of a colossal head at <unk> <unk> in the nineteenth century spurred the first archaeological investigations of <unk> culture by Matthew <unk> in 1938 . Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the <unk> <unk> on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo <unk> were re @-@ carved from massive stone <unk> . An additional monument , at <unk> <unk> in Guatemala , is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head . This is the only known example from outside the <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> the monuments remains difficult because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation . Most have been dated to the Early <unk> period ( 1500 – 1000 BC ) with some to the Middle <unk> ( 1000 – 400 BC ) period . The smallest weigh 6 tons , while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons , although it was abandoned and left unfinished close to the source of its stone . 
 
 = = <unk> civilization = = 
 
 The <unk> civilization developed in the lowlands of southeastern Mexico between 1500 and 400 BC . The <unk> <unk> lies on the Gulf Coast of Mexico within the states of Veracruz and <unk> , an area measuring approximately 275 kilometres ( 171 mi ) east to west and extending about 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) inland from the coast . The <unk> are regarded as the first civilization to develop in <unk> and the <unk> <unk> is one of six <unk> of civilization worldwide , the others being the <unk> <unk> culture of South America , the <unk> culture of China 's Yellow River , the Indus Valley Civilization of south Asia , the civilization of ancient Egypt and the <unk> civilization of ancient Iraq . Of these , only the <unk> civilization developed in a lowland tropical forest setting . 
 The <unk> were the first inhabitants of the Americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle in towns and cities . They were also the first people in the Americas to develop a sophisticated style of stone sculpture . In the first decade of the 21st century evidence emerged of <unk> writing , with the earliest examples of <unk> hieroglyphs dating to around 650 BC . Examples of script have been found on roller stamps and stone artefacts ; the texts are short and have been partially <unk> based on their similarity to other <unk> scripts . The evidence of complex society developing in the <unk> <unk> has led to the <unk> being regarded as the " Mother Culture " of <unk> , although this concept remains controversial . 
 Some of the <unk> ' rulers seem to have served religious functions . The city of San Lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre of the civilization by La <unk> in about 900 BC , with <unk> <unk> and <unk> de los <unk> possibly sharing the role ; other urban centres were much less significant . The nature and degree of the control exercised by the centres over a widespread rural population remains unclear . Very fine <unk> art , much clearly made for an elite , survives in several forms , notably <unk> figurines , and larger sculptures such as The <unk> . The figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery ; these were presumably widely available to the population . Together with these , of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the " <unk> @-@ style masks " in stone , so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of an <unk> context . These evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads . Two thirds of <unk> monumental sculpture represents the human form , and the colossal heads fall within this major theme of <unk> art . 
 
 = = <unk> = = 
 
 The colossal heads cannot be precisely dated . However , the San Lorenzo heads were buried by 900 BC , indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still . The heads from <unk> <unk> had been moved from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from La <unk> were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface . The period of production of the colossal heads is therefore unknown , as is whether it spanned a century or a millennium . Estimates of the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from 50 to 200 years . The San Lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest , and are the most <unk> executed . All of the stone heads have been assigned to the <unk> period of <unk> chronology , generally to the Early <unk> ( 1500 – 1000 BC ) , although the two <unk> <unk> heads and the La <unk> Head are attributed to the Middle <unk> ( 1000 – 400 BC ) . 
 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 
 <unk> colossal heads vary in height from 1 @.@ 47 to 3 @.@ 4 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 to 11 @.@ 2 ft ) and weigh between 6 and 50 tons . All of the <unk> colossal heads depict mature men with flat <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; the eyes tend to be slightly crossed . The general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in the <unk> region in modern times . The backs of the heads are often flat , as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall . All examples of <unk> colossal heads wear distinctive <unk> that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals . Some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head , and some are decorated with feathers . A head from La <unk> is decorated with the head of a bird . There are similarities between the <unk> on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific <unk> may represent different dynasties , or perhaps identify specific rulers . Most of the heads wear large <unk> inserted into the ear lobes . 
 All of the heads are realistic , <unk> and <unk> descriptions of the men . It is likely that they were portraits of living ( or recently deceased ) rulers well known to the <unk> . Each head is distinct and <unk> , displaying <unk> features . They were once thought to represent <unk> although this theory is no longer widely held ; it is possible , however , that they represent rulers equipped for the <unk> <unk> . <unk> expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling . The most <unk> <unk> art is the earliest , appearing suddenly without surviving <unk> , with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed . Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from El <unk> demonstrate that the <unk> are likely to have created many more <unk> sculptures than works sculpted from stone . 
 In the late nineteenth century , José <unk> y Serrano described a colossal head as having " Ethiopian " features and speculations that the <unk> had African origins resurfaced in 1960 in the work of Alfonso <unk> <unk> and in the 1970s in the writings of Ivan van <unk> . Such speculation is not taken seriously by <unk> scholars such as Richard <unk> and Ann <unk> . 
 Although all the colossal heads are broadly similar , there are distinct stylistic differences in their execution . One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint , suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated . Heads did not just represent individual <unk> rulers ; they also incorporated the very concept of rulership itself . 
 
 = = <unk> = = 
 
 The production of each colossal head must have been carefully planned , given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available ; it seems likely that only the more powerful <unk> rulers were able to <unk> such resources . The workforce would have included <unk> , labourers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and other <unk> producing the tools to make and move the monument , in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers . The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end . 
 Archaeological investigation of <unk> basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and small <unk> of stone . The sculpture was then refined by <unk> the surface using <unk> , which were generally rounded <unk> that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case . <unk> were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail . <unk> colossal heads were fashioned as in @-@ the @-@ round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the <unk> and <unk> . Monument 20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche . Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned . It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @-@ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed . 
 All seventeen of the confirmed heads in the <unk> <unk> were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los <unk> mountains of Veracruz . Most were formed from coarse <unk> dark grey basalt known as <unk> <unk> basalt after a volcano in the range . <unk> have proposed that large <unk> <unk> basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments . These boulders are found in an area affected by large <unk> ( volcanic mudslides ) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes , which suggests that the <unk> did not need to quarry the raw material for <unk> the heads . Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head . The stone for the San Lorenzo and La <unk> heads was transported a considerable distance from the source . The La <unk> head was found on El <unk> hill in the Sierra de los <unk> and the stone from <unk> <unk> <unk> Head 1 and <unk> <unk> Head 1 ( also known as <unk> <unk> Monuments A and Q ) came from the same hill . 
 The boulders were transported over 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) from the source of the stone . The exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown , especially since the <unk> lacked <unk> of burden and functional wheels , and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible . Coastal currents of the Gulf of Mexico and in river estuaries might have made the <unk> transport of monuments weighing 20 tons or more impractical . Two badly damaged <unk> sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes . A largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block , with their legs hanging over the side . These sculptures may well depict <unk> rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments . When transport over land was necessary , the <unk> are likely to have used <unk> , ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads . The regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains ; avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country . The construction of temporary <unk> using the suitable and plentiful floodplain soils would have allowed a direct route across the floodplains to the San Lorenzo Plateau . Earth structures such as mounds , platforms and <unk> upon the plateau demonstrate that the <unk> possessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build large @-@ scale earthworks . 
 The flat backs of many of the colossal heads represented the flat bases of the monumental <unk> from which they were reworked . Only four of the seventeen <unk> heads do not have flattened backs , indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments . Alternatively , the backs of many of these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport , providing a stable form for <unk> the monuments with ropes . Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental <unk> <unk> and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments .

 Seventeen confirmed examples are known . An additional monument , at <unk> <unk> in Guatemala , is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head . This is the only known example outside of the <unk> <unk> on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . Possible fragments of additional colossal heads have been recovered at San Lorenzo and at San Fernando in <unk> . <unk> colossal stone heads are also known in the Southern Maya area where they are associated with the <unk> style of sculpture . Although some arguments have been made that they are pre @-@ <unk> , these latter monuments are generally believed to be influenced by the <unk> style of sculpture .

 The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo originally formed two roughly parallel lines running north @-@ south across the site . Although some were recovered from <unk> , they were found close to their original <unk> and had been buried by local erosion . These heads , together with a number of monumental stone <unk> , probably formed a processional route across the site , powerfully displaying its dynastic history . Two of the San Lorenzo heads had been re @-@ carved from older <unk> . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 1 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 1 ) was lying facing upwards when excavated . The erosion of a path passing on top of the monument uncovered its eye and led to the discovery of the <unk> site . <unk> Head 1 is 2 @.@ 84 metres ( 9 @.@ 3 ft ) high ; it measures 2 @.@ 11 metres ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) wide and it weighs 25 @.@ 3 tons . The monument was discovered partially buried at the edge of a gully by Matthew <unk> in 1945 . When discovered it was lying on its back , looking upwards . It was associated with a large number of broken ceramic vessels and figurines . The majority of these ceramic remains have been dated to between 800 and 400 BC ; some pieces have been dated to the Villa Alta phase ( Late Classic period , 800 – 1000 AD ) . The headdress possesses a plain band that is tied at the back of the head . The upper portion of the headdress is decorated with a U @-@ shaped motif . This element descends across the front of the headdress , terminating on the forehead . On the front portion it is decorated with five semicircular motifs . The <unk> piece does not meet the horizontal band , leaving a space between the two pieces . On each side of the face a strap descends from the headdress and passes in front of the ear . The forehead is wrinkled in a <unk> . The lips are slightly parted without revealing the teeth . The <unk> are pronounced and the ears are particularly well executed . The face is slightly asymmetric , which may be due to error on the part of the <unk> or may accurately reflect the physical features of the portrait 's subject . The head has been moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> ( " <unk> Museum of <unk> " ) . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 2 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 2 ) was reworked from a monumental throne . The head stands 2 @.@ 69 metres ( 8 @.@ 8 ft ) high and measures 1 @.@ 83 metres ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 05 metres ( 3 @.@ 4 ft ) deep ; it weighs 20 tons . <unk> Head 2 was discovered in 1945 when Matthew <unk> 's guide cleared away some of the vegetation and mud that covered it . The monument was found lying on its back , facing the sky , and was excavated in 1946 by <unk> and Philip <unk> . In 1962 the monument was removed from the San Lorenzo plateau in order to put it on display as part of " The <unk> tradition " exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston in 1963 . San Lorenzo <unk> Head 2 is currently in the <unk> <unk> de <unk> in Mexico City . The head was associated with a number of ceramic finds ; they have been dated to the Early <unk> and Late Classic periods . <unk> Head 2 wears a complex headdress that sports a horizontal band tied at the back of the head ; this is decorated with three bird 's heads that are located above the forehead and temples . The <unk> piece is formed from six strips running towards the back of the head . The front of the headdress above the horizontal band is plain . Two short <unk> hang down from the headdress in front of the ears . The ear jewellery is formed by large <unk> <unk> or framed discs . The left and right ornaments are different , with radial lines on the left <unk> , a feature absent on the right <unk> . The head is badly damaged due to an unfinished reworking process . This process has <unk> the entire face with at least 60 smaller <unk> and 2 larger holes . The surviving features appear to depict an ageing man with the forehead <unk> into a <unk> . The lips are thick and slightly parted to reveal the teeth ; the head has a pronounced chin . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 3 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument 3 . The head measures 1 @.@ 78 metres ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 63 metres ( 5 @.@ 3 ft ) wide by 0 @.@ 95 metres ( 3 @.@ 1 ft ) deep and weighs 9 @.@ 4 tons . The head was discovered in a deep gully by Matthew <unk> in 1946 ; it was found lying face down and its excavation was difficult due to the wet conditions in the gully . The monument was found 0 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 50 mi ) southwest of the main mound at San Lorenzo , however , its original location is unknown ; erosion of the gully may have resulted in significant movement of the sculpture . Head 3 has been moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . The headdress is complex , with the horizontal basal band being formed by four horizontal <unk> , with diagonal folds above each eye . A small <unk> tops the headdress . A large flap formed of four <unk> drops down both sides of the head , completely covering the ears . The face has a typically <unk> brow and , unusually , has clearly defined eyelids . The lips are thick and slightly parted ; the front of the lower lip has broken away completely , and the lower front of the headdress is pitted with 27 irregularly spaced artificial depressions . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 4 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 4 ) weighs 6 tons and has been moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . <unk> Head 4 is 1 @.@ 78 metres ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) high , 1 @.@ 17 metres ( 3 @.@ 8 ft ) wide and 0 @.@ 95 metres ( 3 @.@ 1 ft ) deep . The head was discovered by Matthew <unk> in 1946 , 550 metres ( 600 yd ) northwest of the principal mound , at the edge of a gully . When excavated , it was found to be lying on its right @-@ hand side and in a very good state of preservation . <unk> materials excavated with the head became mixed with ceramics associated with Head 5 , making ceramic dating of the monument difficult . The headdress is decorated with a horizontal band formed of four sculpted <unk> , similar to those of Head 3 . On the right @-@ hand side , three <unk> descend from the upper portion of the headdress ; they terminate in a total of eight strips that hang down across the horizontal band . These <unk> are judged to represent hair rather than <unk> . Also on the right hand side , two <unk> descend across the ear and continue to the base of the monument . On the left @-@ hand side , three vertical <unk> descend across the ear . The <unk> is only visible on the right hand side ; it is formed of a plain disc and <unk> . The face is that of an ageing man with a <unk> forehead , low <unk> and a prominent chin . The lips are thick and slightly parted . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 5 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument 5 .

The head was discovered by Matthew <unk> in 1946 , face down in a gully to the south of the principal mound . The head is particularly well executed and is likely to have been found close to its original location . <unk> recovered during its excavation became mixed with those from the excavation of Head 4 . The mixed ceramics have been dated to the San Lorenzo and Villa Alta phases ( approximately 1400 – 1000 BC and 800 – 1000 AD respectively ) . <unk> Head 5 is particularly well preserved , although the back of the headdress band was damaged when the head was moved from the archaeological site . The band of the headdress is set at an angle and has a notch above the bridge of the nose . The headdress is decorated with jaguar paws ; this general identification of the decoration is contested by <unk> de la <unk> since the " paws " have three claws each ; she identifies them as the claws of a bird of prey . At the back of the head , ten <unk> strips form a net decorated with disc motifs . Two short <unk> descend from the headdress in front of the ears . The ears are adorned with disc @-@ shaped <unk> with <unk> . The face is that of an ageing man with <unk> under the eyes and across the bridge of the nose , and a forehead that is <unk> in a <unk> . The lips are slightly parted . <unk> Head 5 has been moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 6 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 17 ) is one of the smaller examples of colossal heads , standing 1 @.@ 67 metres ( 5 @.@ 5 ft ) . It measures 1 @.@ 41 metres ( 4 @.@ 6 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 26 metres ( 4 @.@ 1 ft ) deep and is estimated to weigh between 8 and 10 tons . The head was discovered by a local <unk> and was excavated in 1965 by Luis <unk> and <unk> <unk> Chan . The head had collapsed into a ravine under its own weight and was found face down on its left hand side . In 1970 it was transported to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the museum 's centenary exhibition . After its return to Mexico , it was placed in the <unk> <unk> de <unk> in Mexico City . It is sculpted with a net @-@ like head covering joined together with sculpted beads . A covering descends from under the headdress to cover the back half of the neck . The <unk> is divided into four strips and begins above the right ear , extending around the entire head . A short strap descends from either side of the head to the ear . The ear ornaments are complex and are larger at the front of the ear than at the back . The face is that of an ageing male with the forehead <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> under the eyes , <unk> <unk> and deep <unk> on either side of the nose . The face is somewhat asymmetric , possibly due to errors in the execution of the monument . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 7 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 53 ) measures 2 @.@ 7 metres ( 8 @.@ 9 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 85 metres ( 6 @.@ 1 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 35 metres ( 4 @.@ 4 ft ) deep and weighs 18 tons .

 Three of the La <unk> heads were found in a line running east @-@ west in the northern Complex I ; all three faced northwards , away from the city centre . The other head was found in Complex B to the south of the Great Pyramid , in a plaza that included a number of other sculptures . The latter , the first of the La <unk> heads to be discovered , was found during archaeological exploration of La <unk> in 1925 ; the other three remained unknown to archaeologists until a local boy guided Matthew <unk> to them while he was excavating the first head in 1940 . They were located approximately 0 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 56 mi ) to the north of Monument 1 . 
 La <unk> Monument 1 is speculated to have been the portrait of La <unk> 's final ruler . Monument 1 measures 2 @.@ 41 metres ( 7 @.@ 9 ft ) high by 2 @.@ 08 metres ( 6 @.@ 8 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 95 metres ( 6 @.@ 4 ft ) deep ; it weighs 24 tons . The front of the headdress is decorated with three motifs that apparently represent the claws or fangs of an animal . Above these symbols is an angular U @-@ shaped decoration descending from the <unk> . On each side of the monument a strap descends from the headdress , passing in front of the ear . Each ear has a prominent ear ornament that descends from the <unk> to the base of the monument . The features are those of a mature man , with <unk> around the mouth , eyes and nose . Monument 1 is the best preserved head at La <unk> but has suffered from erosion , particularly at the back . The head was first described by Franz <unk> and Oliver La <unk> who investigated the La <unk> remains on behalf of Tulane University in 1925 . When discovered it was half @-@ buried ; its massive size meant that the <unk> were unable to excavate it completely . Matthew <unk> fully excavated the monument in 1940 , after clearing the thick vegetation that had covered it in the intervening years . Monument 1 has been moved to the <unk> @-@ <unk> La <unk> in <unk> . The head was found in its original context ; associated finds have been <unk> dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . 
 La <unk> Monument 2 measures 1 @.@ 63 metres ( 5 @.@ 3 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 35 metres ( 4 @.@ 4 ft ) wide by 0 @.@ 98 metres ( 3 @.@ 2 ft ) deep ; the head weighs 11 @.@ 8 tons . The face has a broadly smiling expression that reveals four of the upper teeth . The <unk> are given prominence by the action of smiling ; the brow that is normally visible in other heads is covered by the rim of the headdress . The face is badly eroded , <unk> the features . In addition to the severe erosion damage , the upper lip and a part of the nose have been deliberately <unk> . The head was found in its original context a few metres north of the northwest corner of pyramid @-@ platform A @-@ 2 . <unk> dating of the monument 's context dates it to between 1000 and 600 BC . Monument 2 has suffered erosion damage from its exposure to the elements prior to discovery . The head has a prominent headdress but this is badly eroded and any individual detail has been erased . A strap descends in front of the ear on each side of the head , descending as far as the <unk> . The head is adorned with ear ornaments in the form of a disc that covers the <unk> , with an associated clip or <unk> . The surviving details of the headdress and <unk> are <unk> similar to those of <unk> <unk> Monument A. The head has been moved to the <unk> del <unk> de <unk> in <unk> . 
 La <unk> Monument 3 stands 1 @.@ 98 metres ( 6 @.@ 5 ft ) high and measures 1 @.@ 6 metres ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) wide by 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) deep ; it weighs 12 @.@ 8 tons . Monument 3 was located a few metres to the east of Monument 2 , but was moved to the <unk> @-@ <unk> La <unk> in <unk> . Like the other La <unk> heads , its context has been <unk> dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . It appears unfinished and has suffered severe damage through <unk> , making analysis difficult . It had a large headdress that reaches to the eyebrows but any details have been lost through erosion . <unk> descend in front of each ear and continue to the base of the monument . The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the <unk> ; they probably represent <unk> ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the <unk> region . Although most of the facial detail is lost , the <unk> of the bridge of the nose is still evident , a feature that is common to the <unk> expressions of the other <unk> colossal heads . 
 La <unk> Monument 4 measures 2 @.@ 26 metres ( 7 @.@ 4 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 98 metres ( 6 @.@ 5 ft ) wide and 1 @.@ 86 metres ( 6 @.@ 1 ft ) deep . It weighs 19 @.@ 8 tons . It was found a few metres to the west of Monument 2 and has been moved to the <unk> @-@ <unk> La <unk> . As with the other heads in the group , its archaeological context has been <unk> dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . The headdress is elaborate and , although damaged , various details are still discernible . The base of the headdress is formed by three horizontal strips running over the forehead . One side is decorated with a double @-@ disc motif that may have been repeated on the other ; if so , damage to the right side has obliterated any trace of it . The top of the headdress is decorated with the <unk> foot of a bird of prey . Either <unk> or <unk> of hair descend on either side of the face , from the headdress to the base of the monument . Only one <unk> survives ; it is flat , in the form of a rounded square , and is decorated with a cross motif . The ears have been completely eroded away and the lips are damaged . The surviving features display a <unk> and <unk> around the nose and <unk> . The head displays prominent teeth .

 The two heads at <unk> <unk> , with the La <unk> head , are <unk> distinct from the other known examples . <unk> de la <unk> views them as a late regional survival of an older tradition while other scholars argue that they are merely the kind of regional variant to be expected in a frontier settlement . These heads are sculpted with relatively simple <unk> ; they have squat , wide proportions and distinctive facial features . The two <unk> <unk> heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site . The discovery of one of the <unk> <unk> heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological investigations of <unk> culture , carried out by Matthew <unk> in 1938 . 
 <unk> <unk> Monument A ( also known as <unk> <unk> <unk> Head 1 ) was the first colossal head to be found , discovered by accident in the middle of the nineteenth century , 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) to the north of the modern village of <unk> <unk> . After its discovery it remained half @-@ buried until it was excavated by Matthew <unk> in 1939 . At some point it was moved to the plaza of the modern village , probably in the early 1960s . It has since been moved to the <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> . Monument A stands 1 @.@ 47 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) tall ; it measures 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 45 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) deep , and is estimated to weigh 7 @.@ 8 tons . The head is sculpted with a simple headdress with a wide band that is otherwise unadorned , and wears rectangular ear ornaments that project forwards onto the <unk> . The face is carved with deep <unk> between the <unk> and the nose and around the mouth ; the forehead is <unk> into a <unk> . The upper lip has suffered recent damage , with the left portion <unk> away . 
 <unk> <unk> Monument Q ( also known as the <unk> Head and <unk> <unk> <unk> Head 2 ) measures 1 @.@ 45 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 34 metres ( 4 @.@ 4 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 26 metres ( 4 @.@ 1 ft ) deep and weighs 8 @.@ 5 tons . Its exact date of discovery is unknown but is estimated to have been some time in the 1940s , when it was struck by machinery being used to clear vegetation from <unk> hill . Monument Q was the eleventh colossal head to be discovered . It was moved to the plaza of Santiago <unk> in 1951 and remains there to this day . Monument Q was first described by Williams and <unk> in an article published in 1965 . The headdress is decorated with a frontal tongue @-@ shaped ornament , and the back of the head is sculpted with seven <unk> of hair bound with <unk> . A strap descends from each side of the headdress , passing over the ears and to the base of the monument . The face has pronounced <unk> around the nose , mouth and eyes .

 The La <unk> region was the source of the basalt used for carving all of the colossal heads in the <unk> <unk> . The La <unk> colossal head was discovered in 1970 and was the fifteenth to be recorded . It was discovered in a mountain pass in the Sierra de los <unk> , on the north side of El <unk> volcano near to Santiago <unk> . The head was largely buried when found ; excavations uncovered a Late Classic ( 600 – 900 AD ) offering associated with the head consisting of a ceramic vessel and a 12 @-@ <unk> ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) long <unk> knife placed pointing northwards towards the head . The offering is believed to have been deposited long after the head was sculpted . The La <unk> head has been moved from its original location to the main plaza at Santiago . 
 The La <unk> head is more or less rounded and measures 3 by 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 by 9 @.@ 8 ft ) by 3 @.@ 4 metres ( 11 ft ) high , making it the largest known head . This massive sculpture is estimated to weigh 40 tons . It is <unk> distinct from the other examples , and <unk> de la <unk> placed it late in the <unk> time frame . The characteristics of the sculpture have led to some investigators suggesting that it represents a deceased person . Norman Hammond argues that the apparent stylistic differences of the monument stem from its unfinished state rather than its late production . The eyes of the monument are closed , the nose is flattened and lacks nostrils and the mouth was not sculpted in a realistic manner . The headdress is in the form of a plain horizontal band . 
 The original location of the La <unk> head was not a major archaeological site and it is likely that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination . Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished , such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base . Rock was not removed from around the <unk> as on other heads , and does not narrow towards the base . Large parts of the monument seem to be <unk> out without finished detail . The right hand <unk> also appears incomplete ; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief , probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished . The La <unk> head was almost certainly carved from a raw <unk> rather than being sculpted from a throne .

 <unk> <unk> Monument 23 dates to the Middle <unk> period , and is found in <unk> <unk> , an important city in the foothills of the <unk> Pacific coast , in the modern department of <unk> . It appears to be an <unk> @-@ style colossal head re @-@ carved into a niche figure sculpture . If originally a colossal head then it would be the only known example from outside the <unk> <unk> . 
 Monument 23 is sculpted from <unk> and falls in the middle of the size range for confirmed colossal heads . It stands 1 @.@ 84 metres ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) high and measures 1 @.@ 2 metres ( 3 @.@ 9 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 56 metres ( 5 @.@ 1 ft ) deep . Like the examples from the <unk> <unk> , the monument features a flat back . Lee Parsons contests John Graham 's identification of Monument 23 as a re @-@ carved colossal head ; he views the side ornaments , identified by Graham as ears , as rather the <unk> eyes of an open @-@ <unk> monster <unk> upwards . <unk> this , James Porter has claimed that the re @-@ carving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident . 
 Monument 23 was damaged in the mid @-@ twentieth century by a local <unk> who attempted to break its exposed upper portion using a steel <unk> . As a result , the top is fragmented , although the broken pieces were recovered by archaeologists and have been put back into place .

 Bradley Kent Stevens grew up in <unk> , Indiana , where he developed his love for basketball . Starting at age five , Stevens would watch taped basketball games " before he went to afternoon kindergarten " . His father would often drive him to <unk> , to watch Indiana <unk> games . " It 's hard not to be [ in love with basketball ] when you 're a kid growing up in Indiana " , Stevens later said . 
 For his eighth birthday , Stevens received a new basketball <unk> . " It ’ s so much fun to dream in your <unk> , " he later remarked . " That ’ s where my friends and I hung out . It was a lot of fun to grow up in that era . " When a friend , Brandon <unk> , had a basketball court installed in his back yard , Stevens " appeared <unk> . " He was so dedicated to the game that he would bring the unprepared ingredients for <unk> cheese sandwiches over to <unk> 's house , so that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwiches to cook . 
 <unk> 's court soon became a gathering place , where <unk> kids and kids from the surrounding areas would hold <unk> games . These games helped develop Stevens ' competitive streak .

 = = Coaching style = = 
 
 According to Stevens , in one of his first games as head coach , he was nervous and " felt like our team played on edge " because of it . He decided that a team 's play will reflect the mood of its coach ; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in difficult game situations , while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge . " I don ’ t want to lose a game because of my approach , " he told himself . Accordingly , he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games . He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional , instead quietly observing on the <unk> with folded arms . He does not get upset about bad calls by <unk> or player mistakes , preferring to focus on " the next play " rather than what just happened . Butler player Willie <unk> explained Butler 's 2010 Final Four run by saying , " When those big runs [ by Syracuse and Kansas State ] came , Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words . Then he said he believes in us , he loves us and we 're going to win the game . " On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player , he does it with " positive reinforcement , just at a little louder <unk> " , according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves . Above all , Stevens wants his players to be confident , not living in fear of being <unk> for making a bad play . 
 <unk> , Stevens is always calm , but internally he is far from it . " I 'm not as calm as everybody thinks , " Stevens says . His wife Tracy adds , " He ’ s calm and collected , but he ’ s fiercely competitive . He ’ s always thinking about how he can beat you . " Former player Joel <unk> says " Everyone sees Brad as a level @-@ headed , calm and cool coach , but he ’ s about as competitive of a guy as I know . We would get into it constantly , whether playing two @-@ on @-@ two or arguing about players ’ having better college careers . " 
 Stevens spends a lot of time preparing for each game , and always tries to add a few new <unk> specific to that game 's opponent . Sports Illustrated calls Stevens an expert " on breaking down tape and looking at statistical trends to find opponents ' weaknesses . " Former player Ronald <unk> agrees : " We know everything we need to about our opponents , all their tendencies are broken down " ahead of time . 
 Stevens is a proponent of using statistical analysis to enhance his coaching decisions , spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film . " I think it 's a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players " , he explains . For example , when Butler was <unk> in late 2010 , Stevens challenged his team : " this [ 46 % defensive field goal percentage ] is where we are . This isn 't acceptable to get to where we want to go . But what does that really mean ? It 's not just get better <unk> , it is , if we give up 3 less <unk> a game , then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country " . The team got the message , improved throughout the season , and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense . In 2012 , Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff . If he had the resources , Stevens says he would hire a team of <unk> to analyze the teams play . 
 Stevens ' teams are built around solid basketball <unk> and good team work , rather than individual basketball skill . His teams are known for their defense , forcing opponents into <unk> mistakes . The secret to basketball – and life – is " just to do the job to the best of your ability and don 't worry about anything else , " Stevens says . " <unk> the next game . <unk> the next possession . That 's our focus . It 's boring . It 's also the way championships are won " , he says . In short , Stevens is a strong believer in " The Butler Way " – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team . " I tell the players ' the Butler Way ' isn 't easy to define , " Stevens says , " but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball , play with great energy and defend . " 
 Stevens prefers to recruit strong team players instead of going after " top recruits . " " The guys we [ have ] recruited , most of them weren 't very highly ranked , " Stevens says . " They had very good high school careers or careers at other places ( transfers ) , but for one reason or the other they weren 't seen as great players . But they all had <unk> . " Stevens puts a strong emphasis on education and has said he would only recruit a " one and done " player if he was committed to getting his degree while playing professionally . 
 Stevens has often been referred to as a coaching <unk> , but is not interested in self @-@ promotion . He instead prefers to <unk> the praise he receives to the players , athletic department , and his <unk> . He has not been known to posture for more money , or to leak his name for open coaching positions . He has been described as humble , modest , and not " about the money " . 
 The New York Times , USA Today , ESPN , and other commentators have attributed Butler 's success against teams with superior athletes to Stevens ' coaching style . The Times remarks , " the Bulldogs are very well prepared for their opponents , and they do not <unk> easily " , and says that the resulting confidence has led to the team 's success . " He coaches to his personality and to his strengths , " <unk> says . " <unk> , he has great <unk> and communication ability with his team . " Yahoo ! Sports compared Stevens to legendary coach John Wooden writing " Brad Stevens is winning at Butler the Wooden way – calm and composed on the <unk> . " Wooden agreed , saying , " I enjoy watching [ Stevens ] and very much enjoy [ Butler 's ] style of play . "

 Brad Stevens is known for his youthful looks , often being described as " baby @-@ faced " . One commentator remarked , " Stevens looks like he checks the mirror every morning to see if it 's time to start <unk> . " On occasion , he has been mistaken for a player . He is also known for projecting a professional , " corporate " look from the sidelines . Asked what his life would be like if he had never taken up coaching , he replies " If everything else remained the same , I would have been as happy as <unk> ... Friends and family and faith , they 're going to take the cake over all this stuff . " Stevens met his wife , Tracy ( née <unk> ) , while attending <unk> University . Tracy , who played soccer for <unk> , quickly learned of Brad 's love for basketball ; on their third date he drove her an hour and a half to attend a high school basketball game . Tracy graduated from Rocky River High School in 1995 , and from <unk> in 1999 . She returned to school in 2000 , driving five hours from Case Western 's law school to Indianapolis on weekends to see Brad .

Brad Stevens has also volunteered his time to the <unk> Foundation for Kids , a charity <unk> <unk> children run by former Butler player Avery <unk> . Stevens remains in close touch with the Butler basketball family ; he notably took a one @-@ game leave from the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith , a player on both of Butler 's Final Four teams who was dying of cancer ; Smith died less than a week later .

 <unk> is an impact crater that lies at the south pole of the Moon . The peaks along the crater 's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight , while the interior is <unk> in shadow ( a <unk> of eternal darkness ) . The low @-@ temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze <unk> shed during comet impacts on the Moon . Measurements by the <unk> <unk> spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater , which may indicate the presence of water ice . The crater is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest <unk> .

 The rotational axis of the Moon lies within <unk> , only a few kilometers from its center . The crater is 21 km in diameter and 4 @.@ 2 km deep . From the Earth , it is viewed edge @-@ on in a region of rough , <unk> terrain . It is located within the South Pole @-@ <unk> basin on a <unk> . The rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted . No significant craters intersect the rim , and it is sloped about 1 @.@ 5 ° toward the direction 50 – 90 ° from the Earth . The age of the crater is about 3 @.@ 6 billion years and it has been in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years . 
 Because the orbit of the Moon is <unk> only 5 ° from the ecliptic , the interior of this crater lies in perpetual darkness . Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth @-@ based radar studies . <unk> along the rim of the crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight , spending about 80 – 90 % of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun . <unk> illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s . 
 The shadowed portion of the crater was <unk> with the <unk> Camera of the Japanese <unk> spacecraft using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim . The interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical 30 ° slope that leads down to a 6 @.@ 6 km diameter floor . The handful of craters along the interior span no more than a few hundred meters . The bottom is covered by an uneven mound @-@ like feature that is 300 to 400 m thick . The central peak is about 200 m in height . 
 The continuous shadows in the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100 K. For <unk> , the average temperature was determined to be about 90 K , reaching 88 K at the crater floor . Under these conditions , the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10 − 26 to 10 − 27 m / s . Any water vapor that arrives here following a <unk> impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface . However , the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far @-@ side , suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice . 
 This crater was named after Ernest Henry <unk> , an Anglo @-@ Irish explorer of Antarctica from 1901 until his death in 1922 . The name was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1994 . Nearby craters of note include Shoemaker , <unk> , de <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . <unk> farther away , on the eastern hemisphere of the lunar near side , are the larger craters <unk> and Scott , named after two other early explorers of the Antarctic continent .

 From the perspective of the Earth , this crater lies along the southern limb of the Moon , making observation difficult . Detailed mapping of the polar regions and <unk> of the Moon did not occur until the advent of orbiting spacecraft . <unk> lies entirely within the rim of the immense South Pole @-@ <unk> basin , which is one of the largest known impact formations in the Solar System . This basin is over 12 kilometers deep , and an exploration of its properties could provide useful information about the lunar interior . 
 A neutron <unk> on board the <unk> <unk> spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to the northern and southern lunar poles , including the crater <unk> . At the end of this mission in July 1999 , the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth @-@ based telescopes an impact @-@ generated plume containing water vapor . The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor , and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals , or that the impact site did not contain any ice . Alternatively , it is possible that the crash did not excavate deeply enough into the <unk> to liberate significant quantities of water vapor . 
 From Earth @-@ based radar and spacecraft images of the crater edge , <unk> appears to be relatively intact ; much like a young crater that has not been significantly eroded from subsequent impacts . This may mean that the inner sides are relatively steep , which may make traversing the sides relatively difficult for a robotic vehicle . In addition , it is possible that the interior floor might not have collected a significant quantity of <unk> since its formation . However other craters in the vicinity are considerably older , and may contain significant deposits of hydrogen , possibly in the form of water ice . ( See Shoemaker ( lunar crater ) , for example . ) 
 Radar studies preceding and following the <unk> <unk> mission demonstrate that the inner walls of <unk> are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some <unk> craters . In particular , the surroundings appear to contain a significant number of blocks in its <unk> blanket , suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface <unk> , and not ice deposits , as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the <unk> mission . This interpretation , however , is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community . Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13 cm show no evidence for water ice deposits . 
 Optical imaging inside the crater was done for the first time by the Japanese lunar <unk> spacecraft <unk> in 2007 . It did not have any evidence of significant amount of water ice , down to the image resolution of 10 m per pixel . 
 On November 15 , 2008 , a 34 @-@ kg probe made a hard landing near the crater . The moon impact probe ( <unk> ) was launched from the Indian <unk> @-@ I spacecraft and reached the surface 25 minutes later . The probe carried a radar <unk> , video imaging system , and a mass <unk> , which will be used to search for water .

 Some sites along <unk> 's rim receive almost constant illumination . At these <unk> sunlight is almost always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels , potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings . The temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of 100 ° C when the Sun is overhead , to as low as − 150 ° C during the lunar night . 
 While scientific experiments performed by <unk> and <unk> <unk> could indicate the presence of water in the polar craters , the current evidence is far from definitive . There are doubts among scientists as to whether or not the hydrogen is in the form of ice , as well as to the concentration of this " ore " with depth below the surface . Resolution of this issue will require future missions to the Moon . The presence of water suggests that the crater floor could potentially be " mined " for deposits of hydrogen in water form , a commodity that is expensive to deliver directly from the Earth . 
 This crater has also been proposed as a future site for a large infrared telescope . The low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations , and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near @-@ continuous power to the observatory . About 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5 @-@ km tall <unk> Mountain , a peak that is <unk> visible from the Earth , and which could serve as a radio relay station when suitably equipped . 
 NASA has named the rim of <unk> as a potential candidate for its lunar outpost , slated to be up and running by <unk> and continuously staffed by a crew by <unk> . The location would promote self @-@ <unk> for lunar residents , as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels . Furthermore , the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture .

 American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film directed by Sam <unk> and written by Alan Ball . Kevin Spacey stars as Lester <unk> , a 42 @-@ year @-@ old advertising executive who has a <unk> crisis when he becomes infatuated with his <unk> daughter 's best friend , Angela ( Mena <unk> ) . <unk> <unk> co @-@ stars as Lester 's <unk> wife , Carolyn , and <unk> Birch plays their <unk> daughter , Jane . Wes Bentley , Chris Cooper , and Allison <unk> also feature . The film is described by academics as a satire of American middle @-@ class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction ; analysis has focused on the film 's <unk> of romantic , and paternal love , sexuality , beauty , <unk> , self @-@ liberation , and redemption . 
 Ball began writing American Beauty as a play in the early 1990s , partly inspired by the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial in 1992 . He <unk> the play after realizing the story would not work on stage . After several years as a television screenwriter , Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting to break into the film industry . The modified script had a cynical outlook that was influenced by Ball 's frustrating <unk> writing for several sitcoms . <unk> Dan <unk> and Bruce Cohen took American Beauty to DreamWorks ; the then @-@ fledgling film studio bought Ball 's script for $ 250 @,@ 000 , <unk> several other production bodies . DreamWorks financed the $ 15 million production and served as its North American distributor . American Beauty marked acclaimed theater director <unk> ' film debut ; <unk> after his successful productions of the musicals Oliver ! and <unk> , <unk> was , nevertheless , only given the job after 20 others were considered and several " A @-@ list " directors turned down the opportunity . 
 Spacey was <unk> ' first choice for the role of Lester , though DreamWorks had urged the director to consider better @-@ known actors ; similarly , the studio suggested several actors for the role of Carolyn until <unk> offered the part to <unk> without DreamWorks ' knowledge . Principal photography took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on soundstages at the Warner Bros. <unk> in Burbank , California , and on location in Los Angeles . <unk> ' dominant style was deliberate and composed ; he made extensive use of static shots and slow pans and <unk> to generate tension . <unk> Conrad Hall complemented <unk> ' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on @-@ screen events . During editing , <unk> made several changes that gave the film a less cynical tone than the script . 
 Released in North America on September 17 , 1999 , American Beauty was positively received by critics and audiences ; it was the best @-@ reviewed American film of the year and grossed over $ <unk> million worldwide . Reviewers praised most aspects of the production , with particular emphasis on <unk> , Spacey , and Ball ; criticism focused on the familiarity of the characters and setting . DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase the film 's chances of Academy Award success ; at the 72nd Academy Awards the following year , the film won Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor ( for Spacey ) , Best Original Screenplay , and Best <unk> . It was nominated for and won many other awards and honors , mainly for the direction , writing , and acting .

 Scholars and academics have offered many possible readings of American Beauty ; film critics are similarly divided , not so much about the quality of the film , as their interpretations of it . Described by many as about " the meaning of life " or " the hollow existence of the American suburbs " , the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers . <unk> is <unk> , saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it : " a mystery story , a <unk> journey through American <unk> , a series of love stories ; [ ... ] it was about imprisonment , [ ... ] loneliness , [ and ] beauty . It was funny ; it was angry , sad . " The literary critic and author Wayne C. <unk> concludes that the film <unk> any one interpretation : " [ American Beauty ] cannot be adequately summarized as ' here is a satire on what 's wrong with American life ' ; that plays down the celebration of beauty . It is more tempting to <unk> it as ' a portrait of the beauty underlying American <unk> and <unk> ' , but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror , and Ball 's disgust with our <unk> . It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky 's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live . " He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center — a controlling voice who " [ <unk> ] all of the choices " . He contends that in American Beauty 's case , it is neither <unk> nor Ball . <unk> considers the voice to be Ball 's , but even while the writer was " strongly influential " on set , he often had to accept deviations from his vision , particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic . With " <unk> voices <unk> on the original author 's , " <unk> says , those who interpret American Beauty " have forgotten to probe for the elusive center " . According to <unk> , the film 's true controller is the creative energy " that hundreds of people put into its production , agreeing and <unk> , inserting and cutting " .

 <unk> called American Beauty a rite of passage film about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment . The <unk> of Lester 's existence is established through his gray , <unk> workplace and <unk> clothing . In these scenes , he is often framed as if trapped , " reiterating rituals that hardly please him " . He <unk> in the <unk> of his shower ; the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined behind bars or within frames , such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor , " confined [ and ] nearly crossed out " . The academic and author <unk> W. <unk> argues that Lester 's journey is the story 's center . His sexual <unk> through meeting Angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to " [ throw ] off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to <unk> " . After Lester shares a joint with Ricky , his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against Carolyn . Changed by Ricky 's " attractive , profound confidence " , Lester is convinced that Angela is <unk> and sees that he must question his " <unk> , <unk> <unk> suburban existence " ; he takes a job at a fast @-@ food outlet , which allows him to <unk> to a point when he could " see his whole life ahead of him " . 
 When Lester is caught <unk> by Carolyn , his angry <unk> about their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her . By <unk> the issue and Carolyn 's " superficial investments in others " , Lester is trying to " regain a voice in a home that [ only respects ] the voices of mother and daughter " . His final turning point comes when Angela and he almost have sex ; after she confesses her <unk> , he no longer thinks of her as a sex object , but as a daughter . He holds her close and " <unk> her up " . <unk> called it " the most satisfying end to [ Lester 's ] journey there could possibly have been " . With these final scenes , <unk> intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a " mythical quest " . After Lester gets a beer from the <unk> , the camera pushes toward him , then stops facing a <unk> down which he walks " to meet his fate " . Having begun to act his age again , Lester achieves closure . As he <unk> at a family photo , the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall , onto which blood <unk> as a gunshot rings out ; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester 's death . His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky . <unk> said that Ricky 's staring into Lester 's dead eyes is " the culmination of the theme " of the film : that beauty is found where it is least expected .

 Like other American films of 1999 — such as Fight Club , Bringing Out the Dead , and Magnolia , American Beauty instructs its audience to " [ lead ] more meaningful lives " . The film argues the case against conformity , but does not deny that people need and want it ; even the gay characters just want to fit in . Jim and Jim , the <unk> ' other neighbors , are a satire of " gay <unk> <unk> " , who " [ invest ] in the <unk> <unk> " that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples . The feminist academic and author <unk> R. <unk> argues that American Beauty uses its " art house " <unk> to direct its message of <unk> primarily to the middle classes , and that this approach is a " cliché of <unk> preoccupation ; [ ... ] the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual ' self ' through denial and <unk> is always open to those wealthy enough to choose , and <unk> enough to present themselves <unk> as a rebel . " 
 Professor Roy M. <unk> argues that the film 's thematic center is its direction to the audience to " look closer " . The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the <unk> ' neighborhood with Lester 's narrated admission that he will soon die , forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them . It also sets a series of mysteries ; <unk> asks , " from what place exactly , and from what state of being , is he telling this story ? If he 's already dead , why <unk> with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive ? There is also the question of how Lester has died — or will die . " <unk> believes the preceding scene — Jane 's discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father — adds further mystery . Professor Ann C. Hall <unk> ; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery , the film allows the audience to put it aside " to view the film and its philosophical issues " . Through this examination of Lester 's life , <unk> and death , American Beauty <unk> American middle class notions of meaning , beauty and satisfaction . Even Lester 's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela ; he therefore remains a " willing devotee of the popular media 's <unk> of <unk> male sexuality as a sensible route to personal <unk> " . Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness ; from her belief in " house beautiful " domestic <unk> to her car and <unk> outfit , Carolyn 's domain is a " <unk> American <unk> vision of <unk> , or Eden " . The <unk> are unaware that they are " <unk> philosophically , and devout consumers <unk> " who expect the " <unk> of American beauty " to give them happiness . <unk> argues that " they are helpless in the face of the <unk> economic and sexual stereotypes [ ... ] that they and their culture have designated for their salvation . " 
 The film presents Ricky as its " visionary , [ ... ] spiritual and mystical center " . He sees beauty in the <unk> of everyday life , <unk> as much as he can for fear of missing it . He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed : a plastic bag , <unk> in the wind in front of a wall . He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was " an entire life behind things " ; he feels that " sometimes there 's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can 't take it ... and my heart is going to cave in . " <unk> argues that Ricky , in looking past the " cultural <unk> " , has " [ grasped ] the <unk> <unk> of the created world " to see God . As the film progresses , the <unk> move closer to Ricky 's view of the world . Lester only <unk> personal satisfaction at the film 's end . On the <unk> of having sex with Angela , he returns to himself after she admits her <unk> . Suddenly confronted with a child , he begins to treat her as a daughter ; in doing so , Lester sees himself , Angela , and his family " for the poor and fragile but <unk> creatures they are " . He looks at a picture of his family in <unk> times , and dies having had an <unk> that <unk> him with " wonder , joy , and soul @-@ shaking gratitude " — he has finally seen the world as it is . 
 According to Patti <unk> , colors are used symbolically throughout the film , none more so than red , which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and " [ defines ] Lester 's arc " . First seen in drab colors that reflect his <unk> , Lester surrounds himself with red as he <unk> his individuality . The American Beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol ; when Lester <unk> about Angela , she is usually naked and surrounded by rose <unk> . In these scenes , the rose <unk> Lester 's desire for her . When associated with Carolyn , the rose represents a " façade for suburban success " . Roses are included in almost every shot inside the <unk> ' home , where they signify " a mask covering a bleak , <unk> reality " . Carolyn feels that " as long as there can be <unk> , all is well " . She cuts the <unk> and puts them in <unk> , where they adorn her " <unk> vision of what makes for beauty " and begin to die . The <unk> in the vase in the Angela – Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester 's previous life and Carolyn ; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer , finally taking the <unk> — and thus Carolyn — out of the shot . Lester 's <unk> at the end of the film is expressed by rain and the use of red , building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release Lester feels . The constant use of red " <unk> [ the audience ] <unk> " into becoming used to it ; consequently , it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his blood <unk> on the wall . 
 
 = = = <unk> and repression = = = 
 
 <unk> argues that American Beauty defines its characters through their sexuality . Lester 's attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for Angela , and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact . Also sexually frustrated , Carolyn has an affair that takes her from " cold <unk> " to a more <unk> soul who " [ sings ] happily along with " the music in her car . Jane and Angela constantly reference sex , through Angela 's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other . Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability . By the end of the film , Angela 's hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester 's attraction to her . Col. <unk> reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim ; he asks , " How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face ? How can they be so <unk> ? " To which Ricky replies , " That 's the thing , Dad — they don 't feel like it 's anything to be <unk> of . " <unk> argues that Col. <unk> ' reaction is not <unk> , but an " <unk> self @-@ <unk> " . 
 With other turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ millennium films such as Fight Club , In the Company of Men ( 1997 ) , American <unk> ( 2000 ) , and Boys Don 't <unk> ( 1999 ) , American Beauty " raises the broader , widely explored issue of <unk> in crisis " . Professor Vincent <unk> charges that in their reinforcement of <unk> " against threats posed by war , by <unk> , and by feminist and <unk> challenges " , these films present a need to " focus on , and even to privilege " aspects of <unk> " deemed ' <unk> ' " . Lester 's transformation conveys " that he , and not the woman , has borne the brunt of [ lack of being ] " and he will not stand for being <unk> . Lester 's attempts to " strengthen traditional <unk> " conflict with his responsibilities as a father . Although the film portrays the way Lester returns to that role positively , he does not become " the <unk> figure implicitly celebrated in films like Fight Club " . <unk> concludes that Lester 's behavior toward Angela is " a <unk> but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again " . 
 <unk> says the film " explicitly affirms the importance of upholding the prohibition against <unk> " ; a recurring theme of Ball 's work is his comparison of the <unk> against <unk> and homosexuality . Instead of making an overt distinction , American Beauty looks at how their repression can lead to violence . Col. <unk> is so <unk> of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder Lester . Ball said , " The movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression and about what [ they ] can do . " The film implies two <unk> <unk> desires : Lester 's pursuit of Angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter , while Col. <unk> ' repression is exhibited through the almost <unk> discipline with which he controls Ricky . Consequently , Ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual , while Angela 's vulnerability and submission to Lester reminds him of his responsibilities and the limits of his fantasy . Col. <unk> represents Ball 's father , whose <unk> homosexual desires led to his own <unk> . Ball rewrote Col. <unk> to delay revealing him as homosexual , which <unk> reads as a possible " <unk> of Ball 's own patriarchal @-@ <unk> fantasies " . 
 
 = = = <unk> and music = = = 
 
 American Beauty follows a traditional narrative structure , only <unk> with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story . Although the plot spans one year , the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death . Jacqueline <unk> says that the plot " occupies [ ... ] no time [ or ] all time " , citing Lester 's claim that life did not flash before his eyes , but that it " stretches on forever like an ocean of time " . <unk> argues that a " rhythm of repetition " forms the core of the film 's structure . For example , two scenes have the <unk> sitting down to an evening meal , shot from the same angle . Each image is broadly similar , with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester 's new @-@ found assertiveness . Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other . Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra , and the image is reversed later for a similarly " <unk> and <unk> " scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment . 
 Lester 's fantasies are emphasized by <unk> and repetitive @-@ motion shots ; <unk> uses double @-@ and @-@ triple <unk> in several sequences , and the score alters to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy . One example is the <unk> scene — Lester 's first encounter with Angela . While the <unk> perform their half @-@ time routine to " On Broadway " , Lester becomes increasingly <unk> on Angela . Time slows to represent his " <unk> hypnosis " and Lester begins to <unk> that Angela 's performance is for him alone . " On Broadway " — which provides a conventional <unk> to the <unk> action — is replaced by discordant , <unk> music that lacks melody or progression . This <unk> score is important to creating the narrative <unk> in the sequence ; it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length . The effect is one that Stan Link <unk> to " vertical time " , described by the composer and music theorist Jonathan Kramer as music that <unk> " a single present stretched out into an enormous duration , a potentially infinite ' now ' that nonetheless feels like an instant " . The music is used like a visual cue , so that Lester and the score are staring at Angela . The sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of " On Broadway " and <unk> time . 
 According to Drew Miller of <unk> , the soundtrack " [ gives ] unconscious voice " to the characters ' <unk> and <unk> the subtext . The most obvious use of pop music " accompanies and gives context to " Lester 's attempts to recapture his youth ; reminiscent of how the counterculture of the 1960s <unk> American repression through music and drugs , Lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music . <unk> ' song choices " progress through the history of American popular music " . Miller argues that although some may be over familiar , there is a <unk> element at work , " making good on [ the film 's ] encouragement that viewers look closer " . Toward the end of the film , Thomas Newman 's score features more prominently , creating " a disturbing tempo " that matches the tension of the visuals . The exception is " Don 't Let It <unk> You Down " , which plays during Angela 's seduction of Lester . At first appropriate , its tone clashes as the seduction stops . The lyrics , which speak of " castles burning " , can be seen as a metaphor for Lester 's view of Angela — " the <unk> , fantasy @-@ driven exterior of the ' American Beauty ' " — as it burns away to reveal " the timid , small @-@ <unk> girl who , like his wife , has <unk> developed a false public self " .

 In 1997 , Alan Ball resolved to move into the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sitcoms Grace Under Fire and <unk> . He joined the United Talent Agency , where his representative , Andrew <unk> , suggested he write a <unk> script to " <unk> [ himself ] to the town as a screenwriter " . Ball pitched three ideas to <unk> : two conventional romantic comedies and American Beauty , which he had originally conceived as a play in the early 1990s . Despite the story 's lack of an easily <unk> concept , <unk> selected American Beauty because he felt it was the one for which Ball had the most passion . While developing the script , Ball created another television sitcom , Oh , <unk> Up . He channeled his anger and frustration at having to <unk> to network demands on that show — and during his <unk> on Grace Under Fire and <unk> — into writing American Beauty . 
 Ball did not expect to sell the script , believing it would act as more of a calling card , but American Beauty drew interest from several production bodies . <unk> passed the script to several producers , including Dan <unk> and Bruce Cohen , who took it to DreamWorks . With the help of executives Glenn <unk> and Bob Cooper , and Steven Spielberg in his capacity as studio partner , Ball was convinced to develop the project at DreamWorks ; he received <unk> from the studio — known at the time for its more conventional fare — that it would not " iron the [ edges ] out " . In an unusual move , DreamWorks decided not to option the script ; instead , in April 1998 , the studio bought it outright for $ 250 @,@ 000 , <unk> Fox <unk> Pictures , October Films , Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , and <unk> Entertainment . DreamWorks planned to make the film for $ 6 – 8 million . 
 <unk> and Cohen involved Ball throughout the film 's development , including casting and director selection . The producers met with about 20 interested directors , several of whom were considered " A @-@ list " at the time . Ball was not keen on the more well @-@ known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become " nervous about the content " . Nevertheless , the studio offered the film to Mike Nichols and Robert <unk> ; neither accepted . In the same year , <unk> ( then a theater director ) revived the musical <unk> in New York with fellow director Rob Marshall . Beth <unk> of the Creative Artists Agency arranged meetings for <unk> with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility . <unk> came across American Beauty in a pile of eight scripts at <unk> 's house , and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make ; early in his career , he had been inspired by how the film Paris , Texas ( 1984 ) presented contemporary America as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme in American Beauty , as well as parallels with his own childhood . <unk> later met with Spielberg ; impressed by <unk> ' productions of Oliver ! and <unk> , Spielberg encouraged him to consider American Beauty . 
 <unk> found that he still had to convince DreamWorks ' production executives to let him direct . He had already discussed the film with <unk> and Cohen , and felt they supported him . Ball was also keen ; having seen <unk> , he was impressed with <unk> ' " keen visual sense " and thought he did not make obvious choices . Ball felt that <unk> liked to look under the story 's surface , a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes of American Beauty . <unk> ' background also <unk> him , because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production . Over two meetings — the first with Cooper , Walter <unk> , and Laurie MacDonald , the second with Cooper alone — <unk> pitched himself to the studio . The studio soon approached <unk> with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under Directors Guild of America rules — $ 150 @,@ 000 . <unk> accepted , and later recalled that after taxes and his agent 's commission , he only earned $ 38 @,@ 000 . In June 1998 , DreamWorks confirmed that it had contracted <unk> to direct the film .

 Ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early 1990s . In about 1991 – 92 , Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center . He watched the bag for 10 minutes , saying later that it provoked an " unexpected emotional response " . In 1992 , Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial . <unk> a comic book telling of the scandal , he was struck by how quickly it had become <unk> . He said he " felt like there was a real story underneath [ that was ] more fascinating and way more tragic " than the story presented to the public , and attempted to turn the idea into a play . Ball produced around 40 pages , but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film . He felt that because of the visual themes , and because each character 's story was .. " intensely personal " , it could not be done on a stage . All the main characters appeared in this version , but Carolyn did not feature strongly ; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles . 
 Ball based Lester 's story on aspects of his own life . Lester 's re @-@ examination of his life parallels feelings Ball had in his mid @-@ 30s ; like Lester , Ball put aside his <unk> to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect . Scenes in Ricky 's household reflect Ball 's own childhood experiences . Ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create Col. <unk> , a man who " gave up his chance to be himself " . Ball said the script 's mix of comedy and drama was not intentional , but that it came <unk> from his own outlook on life . He said the juxtaposition produced a <unk> contrast , giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone . 
 In the script that was sent to prospective actors and directors , Lester and Angela had sex ; by the time of shooting , Ball had rewritten the scene to the final version . Ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script , feeling they were being <unk> ; the final <unk> to alter the scene came from DreamWorks ' then @-@ president Walter <unk> . He convinced Ball by indicating that in Greek mythology , the hero " has a moment of <unk> before [ ... ] tragedy occurs " . Ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that Lester needed to refuse sex with Angela to complete his emotional journey — to achieve redemption . <unk> and Cohen asked Ball not to alter the scene right away , as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired . Early drafts also included a flashback to Col. <unk> ' service in the Marines , a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual <unk> . In love with another Marine , Col. <unk> sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the " sin " of being gay . Ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure of the rest of the film — Col. <unk> was the only character to have a flashback — and because it removed the element of surprise from Col. <unk> ' later pass at Lester . Ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to know what happened to Col. <unk> , though all that remained in later drafts was subtext . 
 Ball remained involved throughout production ; he had signed a television show development deal , so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to American Beauty . Ball was on @-@ set for <unk> and to help interpret his script for all but two days of filming . His original <unk> scenes — in which Ricky and Jane are <unk> for Lester 's murder after being framed by Col. <unk> — were <unk> in post @-@ production ; the writer later felt the scenes were unnecessary , saying they were a reflection of his " anger and cynicism " at the time of writing ( see " Editing " ) . Ball and <unk> revised the script twice before it was sent to the actors , and twice more before the first read @-@ through . 
 The shooting script features a scene in Angela 's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty ; the scene differed from earlier versions , which set it as a " big scene on a freeway " in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body . The change was a practical decision , as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs . The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash , but only half a day was available . Ball agreed , but only if the scene could retain a line of Ricky 's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman : " When you see something like that , it 's like God is looking right at you , just for a second . And if you 're careful , you can look right back . " Jane asks : " And what do you see ? " Ricky : " Beauty . " Ball said , " They wanted to cut that scene . They said it 's not important . I said , ' You 're out of your fucking mind . It 's one of the most important scenes in the movie ! ' [ ... ] If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie , that is the line . " Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence ; set in a <unk> , it presents a " turning point " for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela . By the end of filming , the script had been through 10 drafts .

 <unk> had Spacey and <unk> in mind for the leads from the beginning , but DreamWorks executives were <unk> . The studio suggested several <unk> , including Bruce Willis , Kevin <unk> , or John <unk> to play Lester , and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play Carolyn . <unk> did not want a big star " weighing the film down " ; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The <unk> <unk> and Seven , and 1992 's <unk> Glen Ross . Spacey was surprised ; he said , " I usually play characters who are very quick , very <unk> and smart . [ ... ] I usually <unk> in dark , sort of <unk> waters . This is a man living one step at a time , playing by his instincts . This is actually much closer to me , to what I am , than those other parts . " <unk> offered <unk> the role of Carolyn without the studio 's consent ; although executives were upset at <unk> , by September 1998 , DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and <unk> . 
 Spacey loosely based Lester 's early " <unk> " <unk> on Walter <unk> . During the film , Lester 's physique improves from <unk> to toned ; Spacey worked out during filming to improve his body , but because <unk> shot the scenes out of chronological order , Spacey varied <unk> to portray the stages . Before filming , <unk> and Spacey analyzed Jack <unk> 's performance in The <unk> ( 1960 ) , because <unk> wanted Spacey to emulate " the way [ <unk> ] moved , the way he looked , the way he was in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man " . Spacey 's <unk> is a <unk> to Sunset Boulevard ( 1950 ) , which is also narrated in <unk> by a dead character . <unk> felt it evoked Lester 's — and the film 's — loneliness . <unk> recalled women from her youth to inform her performance : " I used to <unk> constantly . You 'd go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside , and then be inside their house and see the difference . " <unk> and a hair stylist collaborated to create a " <unk> president <unk> " hairstyle , and <unk> and production designer <unk> <unk> researched mail @-@ order <unk> to better establish Carolyn 's environment of a " spotless suburban manor " . To help <unk> get into Carolyn 's mindset , <unk> gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like . He lent <unk> the Bobby <unk> version of the song " Don 't Rain on My Parade " , which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it for a scene in which Carolyn sings in her car . 
 For the roles of Jane , Ricky , and Angela , DreamWorks gave <unk> <unk> <unk> . By November 1998 , <unk> Birch , Wes Bentley , and Mena <unk> had been cast in the parts — in Birch 's case , despite the fact she was <unk> for her nude scene . As Birch was 16 at the time she made the film , and thus classified as a minor in the United States , her parents had to approve her brief <unk> scene in the movie . Child labor representatives and they were on the set for the shooting of the scene . Bentley <unk> competition from top actors under the age of 25 to be cast . The 2009 documentary My Big Break followed Bentley , and several other young actors , before and after he landed the part . To prepare , <unk> provided Bentley with a video camera , telling the actor to film what Ricky would . Peter Gallagher and Alison <unk> were cast ( as <unk> Kane and Barbara <unk> ) after filming began in December 1998 . <unk> gave <unk> a book of paintings by <unk> <unk> . He told her , " Your character is in there somewhere . " <unk> cut much of Barbara 's dialogue , including conversations between Colonel <unk> and her , as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair — their humanity and vulnerability — was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence . Chris Cooper plays Colonel <unk> , Scott Bakula plays Jim <unk> , and Sam <unk> plays Jim Berkley . Jim and Jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal , happy — and boring — couple in the film . Ball 's inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a " bland , boring , heterosexual couple " who wore matching clothes : " I can 't wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring . " Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same <unk> . 
 <unk> insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals , although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater , and the actors could not be present at every one . Several <unk> and suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script . An early scene showing the <unk> leaving home for work was inserted later on to show the low point that Carolyn and Lester 's relationship had reached . Spacey and <unk> worked to create a sense of the love that Lester and Carolyn once had for one another ; for example , the scene in which Lester almost <unk> Carolyn after the pair argues over Lester 's buying a car was originally " strictly contentious " .

 Principal photography lasted about 50 days from December 14 , 1998 , to February 1999 . American Beauty was filmed on soundstages at the Warner Bros. <unk> in Burbank , California , and at Hancock Park and <unk> in Los Angeles . The aerial shots at the beginning and end of the film were captured in <unk> , California , and many of the school scenes were shot at South High School in <unk> , California ; several extras in the gym crowd were South High students . The film is set in an upper middle @-@ class neighborhood in an unidentified American town . Production designer <unk> <unk> likened the <unk> to <unk> , Illinois , but said , " it 's not about a place , it 's about an <unk> . [ ... ] The milieu was pretty much <unk> , USA — <unk> mobile <unk> . " The intent was for the setting to reflect the characters , who are also <unk> . <unk> said , " All of them are very strained , and their lives are <unk> . " The <unk> ' household was designed as the reverse of the <unk> ' — the former a pristine ideal , but <unk> and lacking in " inner balance " , leading to Carolyn 's desire to at least give it the appearance of a " perfect all @-@ American household " ; the <unk> ' home is depicted in " exaggerated darkness [ and ] symmetry " . 
 The production selected two adjacent properties on the Warner <unk> 's " <unk> Street " for the <unk> and <unk> ' homes . The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight — between Ricky and Jane 's bedroom windows , and between Ricky 's bedroom and Lester 's garage . The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col. <unk> — watching from Ricky 's bedroom — mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex . <unk> made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot . The house interiors were filmed on the <unk> , on location , and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed . The inside of the <unk> ' home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles ; the inside of the <unk> ' home was shot in the city 's Hancock Park neighborhood . Ricky 's bedroom was designed to be cell @-@ like to suggest his " <unk> " personality , while at the same time blending with the high @-@ tech equipment to reflect his <unk> side . The production deliberately <unk> the use of red , as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere . The <unk> ' home uses cool blues , while the <unk> ' is kept in a " depressed military palette " . 
 <unk> ' dominating visual style was deliberate and composed , with a <unk> design that provided " a sparse , almost surreal feeling — a bright , <unk> , hard edged , near <unk> @-@ like take on American <unk> " ; <unk> constantly directed his set <unk> to empty the frame . He made Lester 's fantasy scenes " more fluid and graceful " , and <unk> made minimal use of <unk> , feeling that stable shots generated more tension . For example , when <unk> used a slow push in to the <unk> ' dinner table , he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters . He wanted to keep the tension in the scene , so he only cut away when Jane left the table . <unk> did use a hand @-@ held camera for the scene in which Col. <unk> beats Ricky . <unk> said the camera provided the scene with a " <unk> [ ... ] off @-@ balance energy " . He also went hand @-@ held for the <unk> of Ricky 's <unk> footage . <unk> took a long time to get the quality of Ricky 's footage to the level he wanted . For the plastic @-@ bag footage , <unk> used wind machines to move the bag in the air . The scene took four takes ; two by the second unit did not satisfy <unk> , so he shot the scene himself . He felt his first take lacked grace , but for the last attempt , he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground . <unk> was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag . 
 <unk> avoided using close @-@ ups , as he believed the technique was <unk> ; he also cited Spielberg 's advice that he should imagine an audience <unk> at the bottom of the camera monitor , to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a 40 @-@ foot ( 10 m ) screen . Spielberg — who visited the set a few times — also advised <unk> not to worry about costs if he had a " great idea " toward the end of a long working day . <unk> said , " That happened three or four times , and they are all in the movie . " Despite Spielberg 's support , DreamWorks and <unk> fought constantly over the schedule and budget , although the studio <unk> little with the film 's content . Spacey , <unk> and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates . American Beauty cost DreamWorks $ 15 million to produce , slightly above their projected sum . <unk> was so dissatisfied with his first three days ' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to <unk> the scenes . He said , " I started with a wrong scene , actually , a comedy scene . And the actors played it way too big : [ ... ] it was badly shot , my fault , badly composed , my fault , bad costumes , my fault [ ... ] ; and everybody was doing what I was asking . It was all my fault . " Aware that he was a novice , <unk> drew on the experience of Hall : " I made a very conscious decision early on , if I didn 't understand something technically , to say , without embarrassment , ' I don 't understand what you 're talking about , please explain it . ' " 
 <unk> encouraged some improvisation ; for example , when Lester <unk> in bed beside Carolyn , the director asked Spacey to improvise several <unk> for the act in each take . <unk> said , " I wanted that not just because it was funny [ ... ] but because I didn 't want it to seem <unk> . I wanted it to seem like he was <unk> it out of his mouth without thinking . [ Spacey ] is so in control — I wanted him to break through . " Spacey obliged , eventually coming up with 35 phrases , but <unk> could not always keep a straight face , which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times . The production used small amounts of computer @-@ generated imagery . Most of the rose <unk> in Lester 's fantasies were added in post @-@ production , although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed . When Lester <unk> about Angela in a rose @-@ <unk> bath , the steam was real , save for in the overhead shot . To position the camera , a hole had to be cut in the ceiling , through which the steam escaped ; it was instead added digitally . 
 
 = = = Editing = = = 
 
 American Beauty was edited by Christopher <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; <unk> began in the position , but had to leave halfway through post @-@ production because of a scheduling conflict with Me , Myself and Irene ( 2000 ) ( in which Chris Cooper also starred ) . <unk> and an assistant edited the film for 10 days between the appointments . <unk> realized during editing that the film was different from the one he had envisioned . He believed he had been making a " much more whimsical , [ ... ] <unk> " film than what came together in the edit suite . Instead , <unk> was drawn to the emotion and darkness ; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to <unk> to craft the film along these lines . In total , he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit . The opening included a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town . <unk> spent two days filming Spacey against <unk> , but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical — " like a <unk> brothers movie " — and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set . The opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father . This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for Lester 's death , as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane 's request was not serious . However , in the portion he used in the opening — and when the full scene plays out later — <unk> used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt . The subsequent shot — an aerial view of the neighborhood — was originally intended as the plate shot for the <unk> effects in the dream sequence . 
 <unk> spent more time <unk> the first 10 minutes than the rest of the film taken together . He <unk> several versions of the opening ; the first edit included <unk> scenes in which Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester 's murder , but <unk> <unk> these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery , and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production . <unk> believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film " into an episode of <unk> Blue " . Instead , he wanted the ending to be " a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution " . When Ball first saw a completed edit , it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes . He felt that they were so short that they " didn 't really register " . <unk> and he argued , but Ball was more accepting after <unk> cut the sequences completely ; Ball felt that without the scenes , the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that " for all its darkness had a really romantic heart " .

 Conrad Hall was not the first choice for director of photography ; <unk> believed he was " too old and too experienced " to want the job , and he had been told that Hall was difficult to work with . Instead , <unk> asked Fred <unk> , who turned the job down because he did not like the script . Hall was recommended to <unk> by Tom Cruise , because of Hall 's work on Without <unk> ( 1998 ) , which Cruise had executive produced . <unk> was directing Cruise 's then @-@ wife Nicole Kidman in the play The Blue Room during <unk> on American Beauty , and had already <unk> the whole film . Hall was involved for one month during <unk> ; his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script , and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting <unk> . Hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters ; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals , which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals . 
 Hall 's approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked <unk> , to contrast with the turbulent on @-@ screen events and allow audiences to take in the action . Hall and <unk> first discussed the intended mood of a scene , but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary . In most cases , Hall first lit the scene 's subject by " painting in " the blacks and whites , before adding fill light , which he reflected from <unk> or white card on the ceiling . This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light <unk> and the dark areas free of spill . Hall shot American Beauty in a 2 @.@ 39 : 1 aspect ratio in the Super 35 format , using <unk> Vision <unk> <unk> 35 mm film stock . He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the <unk> @-@ filled pool in its overhead shot , creating a frame around Angela within . He shot the whole film at the same T @-@ stop ( <unk> ) ; given his preference for shooting that wide , Hall favored high @-@ speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects . He used <unk> Platinum cameras with the company 's <unk> series of prime and <unk> lenses . Hall employed <unk> Vision <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> stock for scenes with daylight effects . He had difficulty adjusting to <unk> 's newly introduced Vision release print stock , which , combined with his contrast @-@ heavy lighting style , created a look with too much contrast . Hall contacted <unk> , who sent him a batch of <unk> that was 5 % lower in contrast . Hall used a 1 / 8 inch <unk> Black <unk> filter for almost every scene , which he said in <unk> may not have been the best choice , as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its <unk> release print led to a slight amount of degradation ; therefore , the <unk> from the filter was not required . When he saw the film in a theater , Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter , the <unk> from the Super 35 – <unk> conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended . 
 A shot where Lester and Ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between Hall and <unk> . <unk> asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence ; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy , so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building , intending to light from the top of the truck . When <unk> returned , he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen . He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting ; he lit it from the left , with a large light crossing the actors , and with a soft light behind the camera . Hall felt the consequent wide shot " worked perfectly for the tone of the scene " . Hall made sure to keep rain , or the suggestion of it , in every shot near the end of the film . In one shot during Lester 's encounter with Angela at the <unk> ' home , Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights ; in another , he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower , intensifying the light ( although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene , Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced ) . For the close @-@ ups when Lester and Angela move to the <unk> , Hall tried to keep rain in the frame , lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester . He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room .

 Thomas Newman 's score was recorded in Santa Monica , California . He mainly used percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm , the inspiration for which was provided by <unk> . Newman " favored pulse , rhythm , and color over melody " , making for a more <unk> score than he had previously created . He built each cue around " small , <unk> repeating phrases " — often , the only variety through a " thinning of the texture for eight bars " . The percussion instruments included <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , piano , <unk> , and <unk> ; also featured were guitars , flute , and world music instruments . Newman also used electronic music and on " <unk> " tracks employed more unorthodox methods , such as tapping metal mixing bowls with a finger and using a <unk> mandolin . Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the " moral ambiguity " of the script : " It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve [ that ] . " 
 The soundtrack features songs by Newman , Bobby <unk> , The Who , Free , <unk> , The <unk> Who , Bill <unk> , Betty Carter , Peggy Lee , The Folk <unk> , Gomez , and Bob Dylan , as well as two cover versions — The Beatles ' " Because " performed by Elliott Smith , and Neil Young 's " Don 't Let It <unk> You Down " performed by Annie Lennox . Produced by the film 's music supervisor Chris <unk> , an abridged soundtrack album was released on October 5 , 1999 , and went on to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album . An album featuring 19 tracks from Newman 's score was released on January 11 , 2000 , and won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album . <unk> considered the score to be one of Newman 's best , saying it " [ enabled ] the film 's <unk> aspirations " . In 2006 , the magazine chose the score as one of 20 essential soundtracks it believed spoke to the " complex and innovative relationships between music and screen storytelling " .

 DreamWorks contracted Amazon.com to create the official website , marking the first time that Amazon had created a special section devoted to a feature film . The website included an overview , a photo gallery , cast and crew <unk> , and exclusive interviews with Spacey and <unk> . The film 's tagline — " look closer " — originally came from a cutting <unk> on Lester 's workplace <unk> by the set <unk> . DreamWorks ran parallel marketing campaigns and trailers — one aimed at adults , the other at teenagers . Both trailers ended with the poster image of a girl holding a rose . Reviewing the posters of several 1999 films , David <unk> of Entertainment Weekly rated American Beauty 's highly , saying it evoked the tagline ; he said , " You return to the poster again and again , thinking , this time you 're gonna find something . " DreamWorks did not want to test screen the film ; according to <unk> , the studio was pleased with it , but he insisted on one where he could question the audience afterward . The studio <unk> agreed and showed the film to a young audience in San Jose , California . <unk> claimed the screening went very well .

 American Beauty was released on VHS on May 9 , 2000 , and on DVD with the <unk> format on October 24 , 2000 . Before the North American rental release on May 9 , <unk> Video wanted to purchase hundreds of thousands of extra copies for its " guaranteed title " range , whereby anyone who wanted to rent the film would be guaranteed a copy . <unk> and DreamWorks could not agree on a profit @-@ sharing deal , so <unk> ordered two @-@ thirds the number of copies it originally intended . DreamWorks made around one million copies available for rental ; <unk> 's share would usually have been about 400 @,@ 000 of these . Some <unk> stores only displayed 60 copies , and others did not display the film at all , forcing customers to ask for it . The strategy required staff to read a statement to customers explaining the situation ; <unk> claimed it was only " [ monitoring ] customer demand " due to the reduced availability . <unk> 's strategy leaked before May 9 , leading to a 30 % order increase from other retailers . In its first week of rental release , American Beauty made $ 6 @.@ 8 million . This return was lower than would have been expected had DreamWorks and <unk> reached an agreement . In the same year , The Sixth <unk> made $ 22 million , while Fight Club made $ 8 @.@ 1 million , though the latter 's North American theatrical performance was just 29 % that of American Beauty . <unk> 's strategy also affected rental fees ; American Beauty averaged $ 3 @.@ 12 , compared with $ 3 @.@ 40 for films that <unk> fully promoted .

 American Beauty was widely considered the best film of 1999 by the American press . It received overwhelming praise , chiefly for Spacey , <unk> and Ball . Variety reported that " no other 1999 movie has benefited from such universal <unk> . " It was the best @-@ received title at the Toronto International Film Festival ( <unk> ) , where it won the People 's Choice award after a ballot of the festival 's audiences . <unk> 's director , Piers <unk> , said , " American Beauty was the <unk> of the festival , the film most talked @-@ about . " 
 Writing in Variety , Todd McCarthy said the cast ensemble " could not be better " ; he praised Spacey 's " handling of <unk> , subtle sarcasm , and blunt talk " and the way he <unk> Lester with " genuine feeling " . Janet Maslin in The New York Times said Spacey was at his " <unk> and most agile " to date , and Roger <unk> of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times singled Spacey out for successfully portraying a man who " does <unk> and foolish things [ but who ] doesn 't <unk> himself " . Kevin Jackson of <unk> & Sound said Spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances , the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of " both <unk> and hero " . Writing in Film Quarterly , Gary <unk> praised the actors , but said that characters such as Carolyn and Col. <unk> were stereotypes . <unk> accused <unk> and Ball of identifying too readily with Jane and Ricky , saying the latter was their " fantasy figure " — a <unk> boy who 's an <unk> wealthy artist able to " finance [ his ] own projects " . <unk> said Angela was the most <unk> teenager , in particular with her " <unk> familiar " attempts to " live up to an unworthy image of herself " . Maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal , but said their detailed <unk> made them memorable . Kenneth <unk> of the Los Angeles Times said the actors <unk> " <unk> " with what were difficult roles ; he called Spacey 's performance " the energy that drives the film " , saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite Lester not always being sympathetic . " Against considerable odds , we do like [ these characters ] , " <unk> concluded . 
 Maslin felt that <unk> directed with " terrific visual <unk> " , saying his <unk> style balanced " the <unk> and bright " and that he evoked the " delicate , <unk> power @-@ playing vignettes " of his theater work . Jackson said <unk> ' theatrical roots rarely showed , and that the " most remarkable " aspect was that Spacey 's performance did not overshadow the film . He said that <unk> worked the script 's <unk> smoothly , to the ensemble 's strengths , and staged the tonal shifts <unk> . McCarthy believed American Beauty a " stunning card of introduction " for film <unk> <unk> and Ball . He said <unk> ' " sure hand " was " as precise and controlled " as his theater work . McCarthy cited Hall 's involvement as fortunate for <unk> , as the cinematographer was " <unk> " at conveying the themes of a work . <unk> agreed that <unk> ' choice of collaborators was " <unk> " , naming Hall and Newman in particular . <unk> suggested that American Beauty may have benefited from <unk> ' inexperience , as his " anything 's possible daring " made him attempt beats that more <unk> directors might have avoided . <unk> felt that <unk> ' accomplishment was to " capture and enhance [ the ] <unk> " of Ball 's script — the simultaneously " <unk> [ ... ] and <unk> real " characters . <unk> , while critical of many of <unk> and Ball 's choices , admitted the film showed off their " considerable talents " . 
 <unk> cited Ball 's lack of <unk> when writing the film as the reason for its uniqueness , in particular the script 's subtle changes in tone . McCarthy said the script was " as fresh and distinctive " as any of its American film contemporaries , and praised how it analyzed the characters while not <unk> narrative pace . He called Ball 's dialogue " tart " and said the characters — Carolyn <unk> — were " deeply drawn " . One other flaw , McCarthy said , was the revelation of Col. <unk> ' homosexuality , which he said evoked " <unk> <unk> " . Jackson said the film <unk> its clichéd setup to become a " wonderfully resourceful and <unk> comedy " . He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs , it did so with " unexpected nuance " . <unk> criticized how the film made a mystery of Lester 's murder , believing it <unk> and simply a way of generating suspense . McCarthy cited the production and costume design as <unk> , and said the soundtrack was good at creating " ironic counterpoint [ s ] " to the story . <unk> concluded that American Beauty was " vital but uneven " ; he felt the film 's examination of " the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other 's lives " was its best point , and that although Lester and Angela 's dynamic was familiar , its romantic irony stood beside " the most enduring literary treatments " of the theme , such as <unk> . Nevertheless , <unk> believed that the film 's themes of <unk> and conformity in American <unk> were " <unk> " . McCarthy conceded that the setting was familiar , but said it merely provided the film with a " starting point " from which to tell its " subtle and <unk> judged tale " . Maslin agreed ; she said that while it " takes aim at targets that are none too fresh " , and that the theme of <unk> did not surprise , the film had its own " corrosive novelty " . <unk> awarded American Beauty four stars out of four , and <unk> said it was layered , <unk> , complex , and surprising , concluding it was " a hell of a picture " . 
 A few months after the film 's release , reports of a backlash appeared in the American press , and the years since have seen its critical regard <unk> . In 2005 , <unk> named American Beauty as one of 20 " most <unk> movies of all time " ; <unk> accepted the <unk> of the critical <unk> , saying , " I thought some of it was entirely justified — it was a little <unk> at the time . " 
 Currently , the film holds an 88 % score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 180 reviews , with an average rating of 8 @.@ 2 / 10 ; the critical consensus reads , " <unk> cast and <unk> with dark , acid wit , American Beauty is a smart , provocative high point of late ' 90s mainstream Hollywood film . " Metacritic gives the film a score of 86 , based on 33 reviews , indicating " universal acclaim . "

 American Beauty was not considered an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season . Several other contenders opened at the end of 1999 , and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end @-@ of @-@ year lists . The Chicago Film Critics Association and the Broadcast Film Critics Association named the film the best of 1999 , but while the New York Film Critics Circle , the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association recognized American Beauty , they gave their top awards to other films . By the end of the year , reports of a critical backlash suggested American Beauty was the underdog in the race for Best Picture ; however , at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000 , American Beauty won Best Film , Best Director and Best Screenplay . 
 As the nominations for the 72nd Academy Awards approached , a <unk> had not emerged . DreamWorks had launched a major campaign for American Beauty five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5 @,@ 600 Academy Award voters . Its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies . Although direct mail campaigning was prohibited , DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in " casual , comfortable settings " in voters ' communities . The studio 's candidate for Best Picture the previous year , Saving Private Ryan , lost to Shakespeare in Love , so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign . It hired three veteran consultants , who told the studio to " think small " . Nancy <unk> encouraged DreamWorks to produce a special about the making of American Beauty , to set up displays of the film in the communities ' <unk> , and to arrange a question @-@ and @-@ answer session with <unk> for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts . Dale <unk> advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in Beverly Hills — home to many voters — in addition to major newspapers . <unk> arranged to screen American Beauty to about 1 @,@ 000 members of the Actors Fund of America , as many participating actors were also voters . Bruce Feldman took Ball to the Santa Barbara International Film Festival , where Ball attended a private dinner in honor of Anthony Hopkins , meeting several voters who were in attendance . 
 In February 2000 , American Beauty was nominated for eight Academy Awards ; its closest rivals , The Cider House Rules and The <unk> , received seven nominations each . In March 2000 , the major industry labor organizations all awarded their top honors to American Beauty ; perceptions had shifted — the film was now the favorite to dominate the Academy Awards . American Beauty 's closest rival for Best Picture was still The Cider House Rules , from <unk> . Both studios mounted aggressive campaigns ; DreamWorks bought 38 % more advertising space in Variety than <unk> . On March 26 , 2000 , American Beauty won five Academy Awards : Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor ( Spacey ) , Best Original Screenplay and Best <unk> . At the 53rd British Academy Film Awards , American Beauty won six of the 14 awards for which it was nominated : Best Film , Best Actor , Best Actress ( <unk> ) , Best <unk> , Best Film Music and Best Editing . In 2000 , the <unk> Guild of America recognized DreamWorks for the best film publicity campaign . In September 2008 , Empire named American Beauty the <unk> " Greatest Movie of All Time " after a poll of 10 @,@ 000 readers , 150 filmmakers , and 50 film critics , the fourth @-@ highest ranked movie from 1999 ( behind Fight Club , The Matrix , and Magnolia ) . In 2013 , the Writers Guild of America ranked the screenplay number 38 on its list of 101 greatest screenplays . 
 The film was nominated for <unk> 's 100 Years ... 100 Movies ( 10th <unk> Edition ) in 2007 . 
 
 
 = Christopher <unk> = 
 
 Christopher <unk> ( September 21 , 1758 – March 1 , 1827 ) was a prominent Massachusetts lawyer , <unk> politician , and U.S. diplomat . Born into a family divided by the American Revolution , <unk> sided with the victorious <unk> , established a successful law practice in Boston , and built a fortune by purchasing Revolutionary government debts at a discount and receiving full value for them from the government . 
 <unk> entered politics in 1788 , serving briefly in the Massachusetts legislature before being appointed U.S. District Attorney for Massachusetts . He was then appointed by President George Washington to a diplomatic commission dealing with maritime claims in Great Britain . He returned to Massachusetts in 1804 and <unk> state politics , running unsuccessfully for governor several times before winning in 1809 . He served one term , losing to Democratic @-@ Republican Elbridge Gerry in 1810 . He was appointed to the US Senate by Governor Caleb Strong in 1813 , where he led opposition to the War of 1812 . 
 <unk> invested his fortune in a variety of businesses , including important infrastructure projects such as the Middlesex Canal and a bridge across the Charles River . He was a major <unk> in the early textile industry , funding the Boston Manufacturing Company and the <unk> Manufacturing Company , whose business established the city of Lowell , Massachusetts . <unk> was involved in a variety of charitable causes , and was a major benefactor of Harvard College , where the first library was named in his honor . His palatial mansion in <unk> , Massachusetts , now known as <unk> Place , is one of the finest extant examples of <unk> architecture , and has been declared a National Historic Landmark . 
 
 = = Early years = = 
 
 Christopher <unk> was born in Boston on September 21 , 1758 , one of many children of Frances and John <unk> , a successful merchant and <unk> . He was the youngest of their three sons to survive to adulthood . He attended Boston Latin School , and entered Harvard College at the young ( even for the time ) age of thirteen . At the outset of the American Revolutionary War and the Siege of Boston in 1775 , Harvard 's buildings were occupied by the Continental Army , and <unk> temporarily continued his studies in Bradford until Harvard could resume operations in Concord . While at Harvard <unk> participated in a speaking club , and formed significant lifelong friendships with Rufus King and John <unk> . 
 <unk> graduated in 1776 , and promptly enlisted in the Continental artillery regiment of his brother @-@ in @-@ law Thomas <unk> , where he served as a clerk until 1778 . The <unk> family was divided by the war : <unk> 's father was a <unk> who left Boston when the British Army evacuated the city in March 1776 . <unk> was consequently called upon to support his mother and three sisters , who remained in Boston . In 1779 <unk> successfully petitioned the state for the remaining family 's share of his father 's seized assets . 
 
 = = Early legal career = = 
 
 After his military service <unk> studied law with John Lowell , and was admitted to the bar in 1778 after a comparatively brief tutelage . <unk> 's law practice flourished , in part because many <unk> lawyers had fled Massachusetts . <unk> 's clients included <unk> seeking to recover some of their assets , as well as London @-@ based British merchants with claims to pursue . His <unk> were generally well @-@ reasoned , and he was seen as a successful trial lawyer . 
 <unk> grew his fortune by investing carefully in revolutionary currency and bonds . The <unk> he purchased were paper that had been given to Continental Army soldiers in lieu of pay , which they often sold at a steep discount . One batch of <unk> he purchased , for instance , cost him about $ 3 @,@ 700 but had a face value of $ 25 @,@ 000 . In 1785 he married Rebecca <unk> Payne , daughter of a wealthy merchant , maritime <unk> , and director of the Bank of Massachusetts . The couple were known for their social <unk> and became prominent members of Boston society . 
 In 1786 <unk> became concerned about a rise in anti @-@ lawyer sentiment in Massachusetts . <unk> over harsh policies pursued by Governor James <unk> <unk> into <unk> ' Rebellion , which required militia action to crush in 1787 . <unk> was one of several high @-@ profile lawyers assigned to defend participants in the rebellion ( included in this group were Theodore <unk> , Caleb Strong , James Sullivan , Levi Lincoln , Sr. , and Thomas <unk> ) . Although many rebels were ultimately convicted , a large number received amnesty . In 1788 , <unk> was elected a delegate to the 1789 Massachusetts convention that ratified the United States Constitution . His election was contested because Boston , where he lived , was at the time more inclined toward state power . <unk> nonetheless was strongly <unk> , urging support of the new Constitution . 
 
 = = <unk> , banker , and speculator = = 
 
 In 1788 <unk> was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives . He took a leading role in adopting the state 's rules for actions required of it by the new federal constitution . By his proposal the legislature decided that presidential electors would be chosen by a joint session . He also proposed that the state House and Senate agree by separate votes on choices for the United States Senate , a process that would significantly reduce popular input to the choice . His choice was ultimately rejected in favor of a process whereby the House selected a slate of candidates , from which the Senate would choose one . In 1789 <unk> decided to stand for reelection , but lost , owing to strong anti @-@ nationalist fervor in Boston at the time . He managed to win a seat later , when a special election was held after <unk> opened several seats . 
 <unk> 's financial speculations in the late <unk> significantly multiplied his wealth . In 1788 he and Andrew <unk> , a Boston businessman who had retained <unk> for legal services , entered into a secret agreement to purchase Continental <unk> with a face value of $ 100 @,@ 000 in a speculative bid that their value would rise . By late October of that year , the pair had met this goal : <unk> had purchased $ 90 @,@ 000 worth of paper for about $ 20 @,@ 000 , and encouraged <unk> to purchase more than the $ 11 @,@ 000 he had acquired if his funding would allow for it . <unk> also purchased Massachusetts war @-@ related debts , and lobbied Massachusetts <unk> for the U.S. government to assume those as well . 
 <unk> 's <unk> was realized when in 1790 the United States Congress , acting on a proposal made by Alexander Hamilton and supported by <unk> 's friend Rufus King , passed legislation that exchanged Continental and state paper for new U.S. paper at face value . Not only did <unk> win on this exchange , but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it . The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents : John <unk> Adams wrote that <unk> 's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country . 
 The success of <unk> 's speculations prompted him to enter a partnership with <unk> , William <unk> and Daniel Parker in an attempt to acquire U.S. foreign debt obligations on favorable terms . Parker was a business partner of <unk> 's , and <unk> was an influential New York businessman and Treasury Department official whose lavish lifestyle impressed <unk> . The partnership promoted sales of U.S. lands in Europe , and sought to acquire U.S. obligations to France . Although <unk> sank $ 10 @,@ 000 into this venture , it failed : more powerful and experienced Dutch <unk> <unk> the Americans . <unk> also engaged in other ventures with these partners , but apparently carefully stayed with financial speculations , and avoided the partners ' less successful land ventures . 
 Much of <unk> 's financial activity was mediated through the Bank of Massachusetts , where his father @-@ in @-@ law was a director . <unk> himself was elected to its board in 1785 , when he also became a shareholder . During his time on the board the bank <unk> its regulations on loan <unk> , a move that improved the stability of its capital . <unk> used the bank for most of his personal deposits , but also drew on lines of credit for as much as several thousand dollars . The bank shares he held paid relatively high <unk> until 1791 , when the bank received serious competition from the First Bank of the United States . 
 The Bank of the United States was established by Alexander Hamilton to provide stable banking services on a national scale , and sought to open a branch in Boston . Hamilton recruited heavily in the Bank of Massachusetts , and <unk> decided to make the move . He sold his shares in the Massachusetts bank , and became a director of the Boston branch of the U.S. Bank . He also purchased 200 shares in the new bank , a relatively large investment . <unk> was influential in making hiring decisions for the branch , and sought to merge state @-@ chartered banks into the organization , arguing that only a nationally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service . <unk> resigned from the board in 1794 , citing the demands of his law practice . 
 <unk> 's financial successes enabled him to join the elite society of Boston . In 1789 he purchased a large mansion on fashionable <unk> Square , and also bought a country estate in <unk> that grew over time to 300 acres ( 120 ha ) . He had a house built on the estate , most of which he operated as a gentleman farmer . He and other similarly @-@ situated <unk> formed the Massachusetts Society for <unk> Agriculture , of which he served as a trustee for several years ; the organization was not seen as significantly contributing to advances in agriculture . 
 
 = = District attorney and diplomat = = 
 
 In 1789 President George Washington appointed <unk> the first United States Attorney for Massachusetts as a reward for his support . <unk> controversially refused to resign from the state legislature , arguing that the state constitution 's prohibitions against holding multiple offices did not apply to federal posts . He eventually resigned the legislative seat under protest because of pressure from his fellow legislators . 
 <unk> served as district attorney until 1796 . His principal matter of concern was the enforcement of U.S. neutrality with respect to the French Revolutionary Wars . He attempted several times to <unk> the French consul in Boston , Antoine <unk> , for <unk> and operating <unk> out of the Port of Boston , but he was <unk> by local <unk> that <unk> with the French . <unk> was eventually expelled on orders from President George Washington based on evidence provided by <unk> . 
 <unk> also promoted anti @-@ French sentiment with political writings in Massachusetts newspapers . Writing under the pseudonym " <unk> " , he denounced the formation of " Democratic Societies " formed to oppose <unk> policy and support pro @-@ French positions . He suggested to President Washington that someone be sent to England to negotiate with the British . John Jay traveled to London in 1794 and negotiated the Jay Treaty , whose ratification <unk> vocally supported . Although <unk> was hostile to French policy , he was on friendly terms with individual Frenchmen : he hosted the future French statesman <unk> when he visited the U.S. 
 In 1796 Washington appointed him as a commissioner representing the United States to handle maritime claims under the terms the Jay Treaty . As a result the <unk> moved to England that year , establishing a residence in the fashionable Hyde Park area . The commission was established to <unk> claims emanating from British <unk> of American vessels and cargoes , and from British claims relating to violations of American neutrality in the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars . It consisted of three Americans ( <unk> , William Pinkney , and John <unk> ) and two British commissioners ( John <unk> and Nicholas <unk> ) ; <unk> was chosen by the other four because he was deemed to sufficiently " fair @-@ minded " to cast deciding votes in the event of disagreements . That year he was also elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . 
 Although <unk> was well received by the British establishment , the work suffered from what <unk> called a " <unk> of process " , and he considered requesting a transfer in 1798 . In 1800 it ground to a halt because another board established by the treaty to resolve outstanding Revolutionary War claims against the United States had not yet met , and the British stopped the claims processing until resolution of the other issues got underway . <unk> used this break to briefly return to America and assess the condition of his <unk> estate , where the house had been largely destroyed by fire in <unk> . After his return to London , with the commission work still stopped , he and Rebecca embarked on a tour of Europe . They visited Holland , Belgium , and Switzerland , and spent six months in Paris . During this trip , and later ones in England and Scotland , they took note of the architecture of country estates , and began planning a new house for their <unk> property . 
 The commission resumed its work in early 1802 , and had resolved all outstanding claims by August 1803 . It awarded $ 110 @,@ 000 to British claimants and over $ 6 million to American claimants . The lopsided result is due to the vastly larger number of American claims , but also to some key early decisions that favored American interpretations in the processing of the claims , and by a British administration that sought to remain in America 's good <unk> . 
 The <unk> 's social circle in England revolved around his good friend Rufus King , who was appointed Ambassador to Great Britain in 1796 , along with other Massachusetts expatriates . When King left his post in May 1803 he named <unk> to head the London embassy as <unk> d <unk> . Although President Thomas Jefferson never issued a formal appointment , the British government accepted his role for the two @-@ month interval between King 's departure and the arrival of James Monroe as King 's replacement . The <unk> sailed for Boston in the spring of 1804 . 
 Rebecca <unk> used their exposure to European country estates to design a lavish new building for their <unk> estate during their English <unk> . Designed with the assistance of French architect Joseph @-@ Guillaume <unk> and probably also influenced by the works of English architect Sir John <unk> , the house that was built upon their return to the United States in 1804 ( now known as <unk> Place ) is one of the finest extant examples of <unk> architecture .

 Soon after his return to the United States , <unk> <unk> state politics , winning election to the Massachusetts Senate . He was active in the state <unk> Party organization , sitting on its secret central committee . He resumed his law practice , in which he took on as a student Daniel Webster . One of the highest profile cases he took on was the 1807 defense of Thomas <unk> , accused of murdering Charles Austin . <unk> , an older <unk> attorney , had been retained to assist in the collection of a debt from Austin 's Republican father . In the politically charged atmosphere of the day in Boston , <unk> , fearing for his own safety , had armed himself with a <unk> pistol . The younger Austin had , apparently on his own initiative , sought to beat <unk> with a cane , and <unk> fatally shot him in the encounter . <unk> was <unk> by Attorney General ( and future <unk> gubernatorial opponent ) James Sullivan , and the defense also included arch @-@ <unk> Harrison Gray <unk> . <unk> argued <unk> acted in self @-@ defense ; <unk> was acquitted of murder by a jury whose <unk> was <unk> and <unk> Paul <unk> after fifteen minutes ' <unk> . 
 <unk> also resumed business activities upon his return . He invested in a wide variety of businesses and infrastructure , spurring economic activity in the state . His investments ranged widely , including maritime insurance ( where is father @-@ in @-@ law had made his fortune ) , bridges , locks , canals , and textiles . He was a major <unk> in the Middlesex Canal , the <unk> Bridge ( the first to connect Boston to Cambridge ) , and the Boston Manufacturing Company , whose factory proving the single @-@ site production of textiles was in <unk> near his estate . Not all of his ventures panned out : the canal was in the long run a financial failure , as were efforts with other collaborators to develop <unk> Point , the Cambridge side of the <unk> Bridge . The textile mill , however , was a success , and <unk> invested in the <unk> Manufacturing Company . When it decided to locate in what is now Lowell , Massachusetts , <unk> purchased shares in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which operated ( and still owns today ) the Lowell canals . 
 In 1806 <unk> won election to the State Senate . That year the Republicans were in the majority , and the election for governor was close enough to require a <unk> . The legislature <unk> the ballots in a partisan manner ( for example , retaining ballots containing <unk> versions of Republican James Sullivan 's name and discarding similar ballots marked for <unk> Caleb Strong ) . <unk> and other <unk> raised a public <unk> , and the legislature relented , eventually <unk> Strong as the winner . 
 <unk> ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts in 1807 and 1808 against a rising tide of <unk> in the state , losing both times to moderate Republican James Sullivan . The <unk> gained control of the state legislature in 1808 in a backlash against Republican economic policies , but <unk> was criticized for his failure to aggressively support state protests against the <unk> Act of 1807 , which had a major negative effect on the state 's large merchant fleet . <unk> was in 1808 elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives , where he successfully led <unk> efforts to ensure the selection of a <unk> slate of presidential electors . He also spearheaded actions to drive Senator John <unk> Adams from the <unk> Party over his support of Thomas Jefferson 's foreign policy . The legislature elected Adams ' successor nine months early , and gave Adams sufficiently <unk> instructions that he resigned the post and joined with the Republicans . 
 
 = = Governor = = 
 
 <unk> led the <unk> to victory in 1809 against Sullivan 's successor , Levi Lincoln , Sr. , who had taken over as acting governor upon Sullivan 's death late in 1808 . During <unk> 's term the principal domestic issue occupying state politics was a banking crisis stimulated by the federal policy of <unk> trade with Great Britain and France , then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars . Although the crisis caused a number of bank failures in New England , Massachusetts banks largely escaped unscathed . 
 Foreign policy played a major role in <unk> 's administration . The legislature passed resolves opposing the federal government 's hardline policy against trade and diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom ( then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars ) , and <unk> in early 1810 invited Francis James Jackson , who had been rejected as the UK 's ambassador to the US , to visit the state . This pressure may have played a role in President James Madison 's decision to renew relations with the UK and accept Jackson 's credentials . 
 The <unk> of the war threat , and the choice by the Republicans of the popular Elbridge Gerry as their candidate brought a challenge to <unk> control of Massachusetts in the 1810 elections . The <unk> Gerry and Republican <unk> criticized <unk> for his lavish lifestyle , including his palatial <unk> residence and <unk> activities he organized as governor , and highlighted his <unk> family connections while emphasizing Gerry 's <unk> patriotism . Gerry won the election . Jackson did visit Boston , but he was greeted not by <unk> , but Gerry . <unk> ran against Gerry again in 1811 , but lost in another <unk> campaign . 
 <unk> was granted an honorary law degree from Harvard in 1809 . He served on the college 's Board of <unk> from 1810 to 1815 and as a Fellow from 1816 to 1820 . Harvard 's first library building , a Gothic structure built in 1838 of <unk> granite , was named in his honor , but was demolished when <unk> Library was built in its place in 1915 . ( This structure is found on the seal of the city of Cambridge . ) One of the residential Winthrop House 's buildings is called <unk> Hall in his honor .

 In the spring of 1813 , he was appointed by Governor Caleb Strong to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the resignation of Senator James Lloyd . He served from May 5 , 1813 to May 30 , 1816 , winning reelection to the seat in 1814 . He opposed the ongoing War of 1812 in these years , with his earlier diplomatic experience providing valuable knowledge to <unk> interests . He expressed approval of the 1814 Hartford Convention in which the New England states aired grievances concerning Republican governance of the country and the conduct of the war . 
 <unk> <unk> to the Treaty of <unk> that ended the war , but was unhappy that the nation had not gained anything from the war . He resigned in June 1816 , unhappy with the politics of Washington and suffering from poor health . Although he was no longer active in politics , he continued to express opinions on the subjects of the day , opposing the 1820 Missouri <unk> and <unk> the " great <unk> & <unk> " of <unk> Governor John Brooks .

 <unk> remained active in the administration of Harvard , and was active in a number of organizations , including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Massachusetts Historical Society ( whose president he was from 1806 to 1818 ) . He was also elected a member of the American <unk> Society in 1814 . <unk> spent most of his later years at his country estate in <unk> , suffering from worsening <unk> <unk> that made walking increasingly difficult . His declining health and lack of social scene in <unk> led him in 1822 to return to Boston in the winters . He died on March 1 , 1827 in Boston and is buried in its <unk> <unk> Ground . 
 <unk> 's wife died in 1834 ; the couple had no children . The major <unk> of the <unk> estate was Harvard ( which received an estimated $ 100 @,@ 000 ) , although <unk> were also made to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Massachusetts Historical Society . The <unk> estate passed through several hands and was subdivided over time . The mansion was saved from demolition by the <unk> Place Society ( established for the purpose of preserving it ) , which now operates it as a museum . It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970 .

 <unk> was <unk> to have had captured Christians dipped in oil and set on fire in his garden at night as a source of light . This view is based on the writings of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the main surviving sources for <unk> 's reign , but a few surviving sources paint <unk> in a more favourable light . Some sources , including some mentioned above , portray him as an emperor who was popular with the common Roman people , especially in the East . Some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources when reporting on <unk> 's <unk> acts .

 Lucius <unk> <unk> , <unk> , was born on 15 December 37 in <unk> ( modern <unk> and <unk> ) , near Rome . He was the only son of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the Younger , sister of Emperor <unk> . 
 <unk> 's father , <unk> , was the son of Lucius <unk> <unk> ( consul 16 BC ) and <unk> Major . <unk> was thus the grandson of <unk> <unk> <unk> ( consul 32 BC ) and probably <unk> <unk> on his father 's side , and the grandson of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor on his mother 's side . Thus , <unk> had as his paternal grandmother <unk> Major , and also claimed more remote descent from <unk> Minor as a great @-@ grandson — later grandson after Claudius adopted him . 
 Through Octavia , <unk> was the great @-@ nephew of Caesar Augustus . <unk> 's father had been employed as a <unk> and was a member of <unk> 's staff when the latter travelled to the East ( some apparently think <unk> refers to Augustus 's adopted son <unk> Caesar here , but this is not likely ) . 
 <unk> 's father was described by <unk> as a murderer and a <unk> who was charged by Emperor <unk> with treason , adultery and <unk> . <unk> died , allowing him to escape these charges . <unk> 's father died of <unk> ( " <unk> " ) in 39 when <unk> was two . 
 <unk> 's mother was <unk> the Younger , a great @-@ granddaughter of Caesar Augustus and his wife <unk> through their daughter Julia the Elder and her husband Marcus <unk> <unk> . <unk> 's father , <unk> , was a grandson of Augustus 's wife , <unk> , on one side and to Mark Antony and Octavia on the other . <unk> ' mother <unk> Minor , was a daughter of Octavia Minor and Mark Antony . Octavia was Augustus ' elder sister . <unk> was also the adopted son of <unk> . <unk> poisoned her second husband <unk> <unk> , so many ancient historians also accuse her of murdering her third husband , the emperor Claudius .

 <unk> was not expected to become Emperor because his maternal uncle , <unk> , had begun his reign at the age of 24 with enough time to produce his own heir . <unk> 's mother , <unk> , lost favour with <unk> and was exiled in 39 after her husband 's death . <unk> seized <unk> 's inheritance and sent him to be brought up by his less wealthy aunt , <unk> <unk> , who was the mother of Valeria <unk> , Claudius 's third wife . <unk> , his wife <unk> and their infant daughter Julia <unk> were murdered on 24 January 41 . These events led Claudius , <unk> 's uncle , to become emperor . Claudius allowed <unk> to return from exile . 
 Claudius had married twice before marrying Valeria <unk> . His previous marriages produced three children including a son , <unk> , who died at a young age . He had two children with <unk> – <unk> Octavia ( born 40 ) and <unk> ( born 41 ) . <unk> was executed by Claudius in the year 48 . 
 In 49 AD , Claudius married a fourth time , to <unk> 's mother <unk> , despite her being his niece . To aid Claudius politically , young <unk> was adopted in 50 and took the name <unk> Claudius Caesar <unk> <unk> ( see adoption in Rome ) . <unk> was older than his <unk> <unk> , and thus became heir to the throne . 
 <unk> was proclaimed an adult in 51 at the age of 14 . He was appointed <unk> , entered and first addressed the Senate , made joint public appearances with Claudius , and was featured in coinage . In 53 , he married his <unk> <unk> Octavia .

 Claudius died in 54 and <unk> , taking the name <unk> Claudius Caesar Augustus <unk> , was established as Emperor . Though accounts vary , many ancient historians state <unk> poisoned Claudius . According to Pliny the Elder , she used poison mushrooms . It is not known how much <unk> knew or if he was even involved in the death of Claudius . 
 <unk> wrote " ... for even if he was not the instigator of the emperor 's death , he was at least privy to it , as he openly admitted ; for he used afterwards to <unk> mushrooms , the vehicle in which the poison was administered to Claudius , as " the food of the gods , " as the Greek <unk> has it . At any rate , after Claudius ' death he vented on him every kind of insult , in act and word , charging him now with <unk> and now with cruelty ; for it was a favourite joke of his to say that Claudius had ceased " to play the fool " among mortals , <unk> the first syllable of the word <unk> , and he <unk> many of his decrees and acts as the work of a <unk> and a <unk> . Finally , he neglected to <unk> the place where his body was burned except with a low and mean wall . " 
 According to <unk> ; <unk> became Emperor at the age of 17 when the news of Claudius ' death was made known , making him the youngest emperor at that time Although , what <unk> may have meant is that he was in his seventeenth year as his date of birth , also listed by <unk> , would have made him 16 at the time of Claudius ' death . <unk> , in book XIII of his Annals , describes <unk> as being ' scarcely out of his <unk> ' at the time he became emperor . Ancient historians describe <unk> 's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother , <unk> , his tutor Lucius <unk> Seneca , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially in the first year . Other tutors were less often mentioned , such as Alexander of <unk> . 
 Very early in <unk> 's rule , problems arose from competition for influence between <unk> and <unk> 's two main advisers , Seneca and <unk> . <unk> also attempted to influence the young <unk> . <unk> also is mentioned by ancient sources as " <unk> for her son ( <unk> ) " . This <unk> continued as is evidenced by the coin of the both of them . It is extremely unusual to see a women 's face on a coin in the ancient world . It is because of this position of power <unk> felt jealous as Seneca in particular rose up in <unk> 's court as he offered the advice <unk> wanted to hear unlike his mother . 
 In 54 , <unk> tried to sit down next to <unk> while he met with an Armenian envoy , but Seneca stopped her and prevented a <unk> scene ( as it was <unk> at that time for a woman to be in the same room as men doing official business ) . <unk> 's friends also <unk> <unk> and told <unk> to <unk> of his mother . 
 <unk> was reportedly unsatisfied with his marriage to Octavia and entered into an affair with <unk> <unk> , a former slave . In 55 , <unk> attempted to intervene in favor of Octavia and demanded that her son dismiss <unk> . <unk> , with the support of Seneca , resisted the intervention of his mother in his personal affairs . 
 With <unk> 's influence over her son severed , she reportedly began pushing for <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , to become emperor . Nearly fourteen @-@ year @-@ old <unk> , heir @-@ designate prior to <unk> 's adoption , was still legally a minor , but was approaching legal adulthood . According to <unk> , <unk> hoped that with her support , <unk> , being the blood son of Claudius , would be seen as the true heir to the throne by the state over <unk> . However , the youth died suddenly and suspiciously on 12 February 55 , the very day before his proclamation as an adult had been set . 
 <unk> claimed that <unk> died from an <unk> seizure , but ancient historians all claim <unk> ' death came from <unk> 's poisoning him . <unk> , he enlisted the services of <unk> , a woman who specialized in the manufacture of poisons . She devised a mixture to kill <unk> , but after testing it unsuccessfully on a slave , <unk> angrily threatened to have her put to death if she did not come up with something usable . <unk> then devised a new <unk> that she promised would " kill <unk> than a viper . " 
 Her promise was fulfilled after <unk> consumed it at a dinner party from water used to cool his wine , which had already been <unk> , and succumbed within minutes . After the death of <unk> , <unk> was accused of <unk> Octavia and <unk> ordered her out of the imperial residence . 
 
 = = = <unk> and consolidation of power = = = 
 
 Over time , <unk> became progressively more powerful , freeing himself of his advisers and eliminating rivals to the throne . In 55 , he removed Marcus Antonius Pallas , an ally of <unk> , from his position in the treasury . Pallas , along with <unk> , was accused of conspiring against the Emperor to bring <unk> <unk> to the throne . Seneca was accused of having relations with <unk> and <unk> . Seneca succeeded in having himself , Pallas and <unk> acquitted . According to <unk> <unk> , at this time , Seneca and <unk> reduced their role in governing from careful management to mere <unk> of <unk> . 
 In 58 , <unk> became romantically involved with <unk> <unk> , the wife of his friend and future emperor <unk> . Reportedly because a marriage to <unk> and a divorce from Octavia did not seem politically feasible with <unk> alive , <unk> ordered the murder of his mother in 59 . A number of modern historians find this an unlikely motive as <unk> did not marry <unk> until 62 . 
 Additionally , according to <unk> , <unk> did not divorce her husband until after <unk> 's death , making it unlikely that the already married <unk> would be pressing <unk> for marriage . Some modern historians <unk> that <unk> 's execution of <unk> was prompted by her plotting to set <unk> <unk> on the throne . According to <unk> , <unk> tried to kill his mother through a <unk> planned by his <unk> tutor <unk> . Instead , it took the life of <unk> 's friend , <unk> <unk> . When <unk> survived , he had her executed by <unk> and framed it as a suicide . The incident is also recorded by <unk> . 
 In 62 , <unk> 's adviser , <unk> , died . Additionally , Seneca was again faced with <unk> charges . Seneca asked <unk> for permission to retire from public affairs . <unk> divorced and banished Octavia on grounds of infertility , leaving him free to marry the pregnant <unk> . After public protests , <unk> was forced to allow Octavia to return from exile , but she was executed shortly after her return . 
 <unk> also was reported to have kicked <unk> to death in 65 before she could have his second child . However , modern historians , noting <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> 's possible bias against <unk> and the likelihood that they did not have <unk> accounts of private events , <unk> that <unk> may have died because of complications of <unk> or childbirth . 
 <unk> of treason being plotted against <unk> and the Senate first appeared in 62 . The Senate ruled that <unk> , a <unk> , should be put to death for speaking ill of <unk> at a party . Later , <unk> ordered the exile of <unk> <unk> who <unk> the Senate in a book . <unk> writes that the roots of the conspiracy led by <unk> <unk> <unk> began in this year . To consolidate power , <unk> executed a number of people in 62 and 63 including his rivals Pallas , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . According to <unk> , <unk> " showed neither discrimination nor <unk> in putting to death <unk> he pleased " during this period . 
 <unk> 's consolidation of power also included a slow <unk> of authority from the Senate . In 54 , <unk> promised to give the Senate powers equivalent to those under Republican rule . By 65 , <unk> complained that they had no power left and this led to the <unk> conspiracy .

 When <unk> 's wife <unk> <unk> died in 65 , <unk> went into deep mourning . Her body was not <unk> , it was <unk> with spices , embalmed and put in the <unk> of Augustus . She was given a state funeral . <unk> praised her during the funeral <unk> and gave her divine honors . It is said that <unk> " burned ten years ' worth of Arabia 's incense production at her funeral . 
 In the beginning of 66 , he married <unk> <unk> . She was already married when she became <unk> 's mistress in 65 AD , with <unk> 's husband being driven to suicide in 66 , so <unk> could marry <unk> . She was one of the few of <unk> 's courtiers who survived the fall of his reign . 
 In 67 , <unk> ordered a young <unk> , <unk> , to be <unk> and then married him . According to Dion <unk> , <unk> bore an <unk> resemblance to <unk> , and <unk> even called him by his dead wife 's name .

 In 55 , <unk> began taking on a more active role as an administrator . He was consul four times between 55 and 60 . During this period , some ancient historians speak fairly well of <unk> and contrast it with his later rule . 
 Under <unk> , restrictions were put on the amount of bail and fines . Also , fees for lawyers were limited . There was a discussion in the Senate on the <unk> of the freedmen class , and a strong demand was made that patrons should have the right of <unk> freedom . <unk> supported the freedmen and ruled that patrons had no such right . 
 The Senate tried to pass a law in which the crimes of one slave applied to all slaves within a household . Despite riots from the people , <unk> supported the Senate on their measure , and deployed troops to organise the execution of 400 slaves affected by the law . However , he vetoed strong measures against the freedmen affected by the case . 
 After tax collectors were accused of being too harsh to the poor , <unk> transferred collection authority to lower commissioners . <unk> banned any magistrate or <unk> from exhibiting public entertainment for fear that the venue was being used as a method to sway the populace . Additionally , there were many <unk> and <unk> of government officials along with arrests for <unk> and corruption . 
 When further complaints arose that the poor were being overly <unk> , <unk> attempted to repeal all indirect taxes . The Senate convinced him this action would bankrupt the public treasury . As a compromise , taxes were cut from 4 @.@ 5 % to 2 @.@ 5 % . Additionally , secret government tax records were ordered to become public . To lower the cost of food imports , merchant ships were declared tax @-@ exempt . 
 In imitation of the Greeks , <unk> built a number of <unk> and theatres . <unk> <unk> shows were also held . <unk> also established the <unk> <unk> . The festival included games , poetry , and theater . Historians indicate that there was a belief that theatre led to <unk> . Others considered that to have performers dressed in Greek clothing was old fashioned . Some questioned the large public expenditure on entertainment . 
 In 64 , Rome burned . <unk> enacted a public relief effort as well as significant reconstruction . A number of other major construction projects occurred in <unk> 's late reign . <unk> had the marshes of <unk> filled with rubble from the fire . He erected the large <unk> <unk> . In 67 , <unk> attempted to have a canal dug at the Isthmus of <unk> . Ancient historians state that these projects and others exacerbated the drain on the State 's budget . 
 The cost to rebuild Rome was immense , requiring funds the state treasury did not have . <unk> <unk> the Roman currency for the first time in the Empire 's history . He reduced the weight of the <unk> from 84 per Roman pound to 96 ( 3 @.@ 85 grams to 3 @.@ 35 grams ) . He also reduced the silver purity from 99 @.@ 5 % to 93 @.@ 5 % — the silver weight dropping from 3 @.@ 83 grams to 3 @.@ 4 grams . Furthermore , <unk> reduced the weight of the <unk> from 40 per Roman pound to 45 ( 8 grams to 7 @.@ 2 grams ) . 
 Between 62 and 67 , according to <unk> the Elder and Seneca , <unk> promoted an expedition to discover the sources of the Nile River . It was the first exploration of equatorial Africa from Europe in history . However , <unk> 's expedition up the Nile failed upon reaching the impenetrable <unk> of present @-@ day South Sudan . 
 The economic policy of <unk> is a point of debate among scholars . According to ancient historians , <unk> 's construction projects were overly extravagant and the large number of <unk> under <unk> left Italy " thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money " with " the provinces ruined . " Modern historians , though , note that the period was riddled with <unk> and that it is likely that <unk> 's spending came in the form of public works projects and charity intended to ease economic troubles . 
 
 = = = Great Fire of Rome ( 64 AD ) = = = 
 
 The Great Fire of Rome erupted on the night of 18 July to 19 July 64 . The fire started at the southeastern end of the Circus <unk> in shops selling flammable goods . 
 The extent of the fire is uncertain . According to <unk> , who was nine at the time of the fire , it spread quickly and burned for over five days . It destroyed three of fourteen Roman districts and severely damaged seven . The only other historian who lived through the period and mentioned the fire is Pliny the Elder , who wrote about it in passing . Other historians who lived through the period ( including <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) make no mention of it in what remains of their work . 
 It is uncertain who or what actually caused the fire — whether accident or <unk> . <unk> and <unk> <unk> favor <unk> as the <unk> , so he could build a palatial complex . <unk> mentions that Christians confessed to the crime , but it is not known whether these <unk> were induced by torture . However , accidental fires were common in ancient Rome . In fact , Rome suffered other large fires in 69 and in 80 . 
 It was said by <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> sang the " <unk> of <unk> " in stage costume while the city burned . Popular legend claims that <unk> played the <unk> at the time of the fire , an anachronism based merely on the concept of the <unk> , a <unk> instrument associated with <unk> and his performances . ( The <unk> was not invented until the 10th century . ) <unk> 's account , however , has <unk> in <unk> at the time of the fire . <unk> also said that <unk> playing his <unk> and singing while the city burned was only rumor . 
 According to <unk> , upon hearing news of the fire , <unk> returned to Rome to organize a relief effort , which he paid for from his own funds . <unk> 's contributions to the relief extended to personally taking part in the search for and rescue of victims of the <unk> , spending days searching the debris without even his <unk> . After the fire , <unk> opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless , and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors . 
 In the wake of the fire , he made a new urban development plan . Houses after the fire were spaced out , built in brick , and faced by <unk> on wide roads . <unk> also built a new palace complex known as the <unk> <unk> in an area cleared by the fire . This included lush artificial landscapes and a 30 @-@ meter @-@ tall statue of himself , the <unk> of <unk> . The size of this complex is debated ( from 100 to 300 acres ) . To find the necessary funds for the reconstruction , tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empire . 
 <unk> , in one of the earliest non @-@ Christian references to the origins of Christianity , notes that the population searched for a <unk> and rumors held <unk> responsible . To <unk> blame , <unk> targeted Christians . He ordered Christians to be thrown to dogs , while others were <unk> and burned .

 <unk> enjoyed driving a one @-@ horse chariot , singing to the <unk> and poetry . He even composed songs that were performed by other <unk> throughout the empire . At first , <unk> only performed for a private audience . 
 In 64 AD . , <unk> began singing in public in <unk> in order to improve his popularity . He also sang at the second <unk> <unk> in 65 . It was said that <unk> <unk> the attention , but historians also write that <unk> was encouraged to sing and perform in public by the Senate , his inner circle and the people . Ancient historians strongly criticize his choice to perform , calling it <unk> . 
 <unk> was persuaded to participate in the Olympic Games of 67 in order to improve relations with Greece and display Roman dominance . As a competitor , <unk> raced a ten @-@ horse chariot and nearly died after being thrown from it . He also performed as an actor and a singer .

 Shortly after <unk> 's accession to the throne in 54 , the Roman vassal kingdom of Armenia <unk> their Iberian prince <unk> and he was replaced with the <unk> prince <unk> . This was seen as a <unk> invasion of Roman territory . There was concern in Rome over how the young Emperor would handle the situation . <unk> reacted by immediately sending the military to the region under the command of <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> temporarily relinquished control of Armenia to Rome . 
 The peace did not last and full @-@ scale war broke out in 58 . The <unk> king <unk> I refused to remove his brother <unk> from Armenia . The <unk> began a full @-@ scale invasion of the Armenian kingdom .

There was anxiety in Rome about eastern grain supplies and a budget deficit . 
 The result was a deal where <unk> again became the Armenian king , but was crowned in Rome by Emperor <unk> . In the future , the king of Armenia was to be a <unk> prince , but his appointment required approval from the Romans . <unk> was forced to come to Rome and <unk> in ceremonies meant to display Roman dominance . 
 This peace deal of 63 was a considerable victory for <unk> politically . <unk> became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the <unk> as well . The peace between <unk> and Rome lasted 50 years until Emperor Trajan of Rome invaded Armenia in 114 .

 The war with <unk> was not <unk> 's only major war but he was both criticized and praised for an aversion to battle . Like many emperors , <unk> faced a number of rebellions and power struggles within the empire . 
 British <unk> of 60 – 61 ( <unk> 's Uprising ) 
 In 60 , a major rebellion broke out in the province of Britannia . While the governor <unk> <unk> <unk> and his troops were busy capturing the island of Mona ( Anglesey ) from the <unk> , the tribes of the southeast staged a revolt led by queen <unk> of the <unk> . <unk> and her troops destroyed three cities before the army of <unk> could return , receive reinforcements , and quell the rebellion in 61 . Fearing <unk> himself would provoke further rebellion , <unk> replaced him with the more passive <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 The <unk> <unk> of 65 
 In 65 , <unk> <unk> <unk> , a Roman statesman , organized a conspiracy against <unk> with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , a <unk> and a <unk> of the <unk> Guard . According to <unk> , many conspirators wished to " rescue the state " from the emperor and restore the Republic . The <unk> <unk> discovered the conspiracy and reported it to <unk> 's secretary , <unk> . As a result , the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including <unk> , the poet . <unk> 's previous advisor , Seneca was ordered to commit suicide after admitting he discussed the plot with the conspirators . 
 The First Jewish War of 66 – 70 
 In 66 , there was a Jewish revolt in Judea stemming from Greek and Jewish religious tension . In 67 , <unk> dispatched <unk> to restore order . This revolt was eventually put down in 70 , after <unk> 's death . This revolt is famous for Romans breaching the walls of Jerusalem and destroying the Second Temple of Jerusalem . 
 
 = = = The revolt of <unk> and <unk> and the death of <unk> = = = 
 
 In March 68 , <unk> Julius <unk> , the governor of Gallia <unk> , rebelled against <unk> 's tax policies . Lucius <unk> Rufus , the governor of <unk> Superior , was ordered to put down <unk> 's rebellion . In an attempt to gain support from outside his own province , <unk> called upon <unk> <unk> <unk> , the governor of <unk> <unk> , to join the rebellion and further , to declare himself emperor in opposition to <unk> . 
 At the Battle of <unk> in May 68 , <unk> ' forces easily defeated those of <unk> and the latter committed suicide . However , after putting down this one rebel , <unk> ' <unk> attempted to proclaim their own commander as Emperor . <unk> refused to act against <unk> , but the discontent of the <unk> of Germany and the continued opposition of <unk> in Spain did not <unk> well for him . 
 While <unk> had retained some control of the situation , support for <unk> increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy . The prefect of the <unk> Guard , <unk> <unk> <unk> , also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support for <unk> . 
 In response , <unk> fled Rome with the intention of going to the port of <unk> and , from there , to take a fleet to one of the still @-@ loyal eastern provinces . According to <unk> , <unk> abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands , responding with a line from <unk> 's <unk> : " Is it so <unk> a thing then to die ? " <unk> then <unk> with the idea of fleeing to <unk> , throwing himself upon the mercy of <unk> , or to appeal to the people and beg them to pardon him for his past offences " and if he could not <unk> their hearts , to <unk> them at least to allow him the prefecture of Egypt " . <unk> reports that the text of this speech was later found in <unk> 's writing desk , but that he <unk> not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the <unk> . 
 <unk> returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace . After sleeping , he <unk> at about midnight to find the palace guard had left . <unk> messages to his friends ' palace chambers for them to come , he received no answers . Upon going to their chambers personally , he found them all abandoned . When he called for a <unk> or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him , no one appeared . He cried , " Have I neither friend nor <unk> ? " and ran out as if to throw himself into the Tiber . 
 Returning , <unk> sought for some place where he could hide and collect his thoughts . An imperial <unk> , <unk> , offered his villa , located 4 miles outside the city . Travelling in disguise , <unk> and four loyal freedmen , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , reached the villa , where <unk> ordered them to dig a grave for him . 
 At this time , a <unk> arrived with a report that the Senate had declared <unk> a public enemy and that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the <unk> . The Senate actually was still reluctant and <unk> on the right course of action as <unk> was the last member of the Julio @-@ <unk> Family . Indeed , most of the <unk> had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline , if not to <unk> himself . The men actually had the goal of returning <unk> back to the Senate , where the Senate hoped to work out a compromise with the <unk> governors that would preserve <unk> 's life , so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced . 
 <unk> , however , did not know this , and at the news brought by the <unk> , he prepared himself for suicide , pacing up and down <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> " which translates to English as " What an artist dies in me . " <unk> his <unk> , he first <unk> for one of his companions to set an example by first killing himself . At last , the sound of approaching horsemen drove <unk> to face the end . However , he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead he forced his private secretary , <unk> , to perform the task . 
 When one of the horsemen entered , upon his seeing <unk> all but dead he attempted to stop the bleeding in vain . <unk> 's final words were " Too late ! This is fidelity ! " He died on 9 June 68 , the anniversary of the death of Octavia , and was buried in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , in what is now the Villa <unk> ( <unk> Hill ) area of Rome . 
 With his death , the Julio @-@ <unk> dynasty ended . The Senate , when news of his death reached Rome , posthumously declared <unk> a public enemy to appease the coming <unk> ( as the Senate had initially declared <unk> as a public enemy ) and proclaimed <unk> the new emperor . Chaos would ensue in the year of the Four <unk> .
