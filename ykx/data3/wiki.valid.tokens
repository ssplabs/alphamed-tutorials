 There are six bridges along current or former sections of US 2 that MDOT has added to its listing of Michigan 's Historic Bridges ; two of these are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( <unk> ) . A third bridge added to the <unk> in late 2012 has not been added to MDOT 's listing however . The first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the Iron River , which has since been bypassed by a new bridge . The original structure , dating to 1918 , is a 55 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 17 m ) <unk> arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No. 191 . The structure was listed on the <unk> on December 9 , 1999 , for its architectural and engineering significance . 
 In December 2012 , the National Park Service approved the listing of the Upper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the <unk> River northwest of Iron Mountain . The structure is a single @-@ span , pin @-@ connected , <unk> , through @-@ <unk> bridge , and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan . It was built between 1909 and 1910 because the Twin Falls Power Dam would flood an existing river crossing . The span cost $ 5 @,@ 106 ( equivalent to $ 780 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , paid equally by Dickinson and Florence counties . Until the 1930s , the Upper Twin Falls Bridge carried US 2 across the <unk> River . In 1934 , a new bridge was built about a mile downstream , and the highway was rerouted over the new span . The bridge closed to automobile traffic in September 1971 , and the nomination process for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places began in 2012 . 
 In 2003 , MDOT replaced the Sturgeon River Bridge in <unk> Township , Dickinson County . As of October 2011 , even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced , MDOT retained it on their historic bridge list . It was built in 1929 . 
 Before 1983 , US 2 used a different routing through <unk> and crossed the <unk> River on what is nicknamed the " <unk> Bridge " . Built as a part of a <unk> <unk> on the river , the water level is actually higher than the road surface . This produces a <unk> effect , giving the bridge its nickname . The <unk> <unk> and Paper Company was organized in 1916 and needed a dam on the <unk> River to supply their mill . This dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded , and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction . Instead of expensive <unk> , a concrete tank was built <unk> in the river bed ; the sides of this tank provided man @-@ made banks higher than the natural banks . The Michigan Works Progress Administration described the bridge as having " concrete bulkheads , formed by the side spans of the bridge , [ that ] allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed . " The <unk> Tourism Council stated : " At one time , the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was <unk> forced under it , " and that the bridge has been featured in Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! . The eight @-@ span structure is <unk> feet ( 90 m ) long . 
 The Cut River Bridge carries US 2 across the Cut River in <unk> Township , Mackinac County . This structure was built during World War II but completion was delayed due to war @-@ induced steel shortages . The span uses <unk> short tons ( <unk> long tons ; <unk> t ) of structural steel to bridge the <unk> feet ( 195 m ) over the river and its <unk> at a height of 147 feet ( 45 m ) above the river . The Cut River Bridge is one of only two <unk> deck <unk> bridges in the state . On either side of the bridge , there are picnic areas and trails down to the river . 
 Listed on the <unk> on December 17 , 1999 , the Mackinac Trail – <unk> River Bridge carries H @-@ 63 , the modern successor to US 2 , over the <unk> River north of St. Ignace . The bridge is another <unk> arch structure 60 feet ( 18 m ) in length and built in 1920 . Increasing traffic along Mackinac Trail prompted the MSHD to " widen its deck by five feet [ 1 @.@ 5 m ] and install new <unk> in the 1929 – 1930 <unk> " along with the addition of decorative retaining walls . 
 The last of the historic bridges along a former segment of US 2 is the structure carrying <unk> Street ( BS I ‑ 75 ) over the Power Canal in <unk> <unk> . Marie . Built in 1934 , it is one of only three steel arch bridges in the state . The 42 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 13 m ) and 257 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 78 m ) structure is described by MDOT as " massive " with an " innovative " construction method : the previous structure was used as a <unk> for the current bridge before removal .

 = Butterfly World Tour = 
 
 The Butterfly World Tour was the third concert tour by American singer @-@ songwriter Mariah Carey . The tour promoted Carey 's album at the time , Butterfly ( 1997 ) , and included songs from several of her previous albums . The tour visited Asia , Australia and the United States , with rehearsals taking place in December 1997 . Starting on January 11 , 1998 the tour spanned five shows in Asia , six in Australia , and one in Hawaii , US . Throughout the tour , Carey varied hairstyles and outfits , as well as song selections . The Butterfly World Tour was very successful ; the four dates at Japan 's largest stadium , Tokyo <unk> , sold out in under one hour , <unk> over 200 @,@ 000 tickets , breaking the previous record she held at the stadium for show sell @-@ outs . 
 The tour was recorded in VHS format , and was titled Around the World . The video featured live performances of Carey at different worldwide venues including New York , Japan , Hawaii and Brisbane . Other scenes are included in the video such as a conversation between Carey and Brenda K. Starr prior to her performance of " I Still Believe " . Prior to the performances in Australia , a scene of Carey swimming with <unk> is shown . Additionally , Olivia Newton @-@ John makes a cameo appearance during their joint performance of Newton @-@ John 's song , " <unk> <unk> to You " . The video was commercially successful , being certified platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and gold in Brazil by the <unk> <unk> dos <unk> de <unk> ( <unk> ) .

 Since her debut in 1990 , Carey had not journeyed on a large or extensive tour . In fact , she had not embarked on a tour until her third studio effort , Music Box ( 1993 ) , when she performed six arena shows in the United States during the Music Box Tour . The opening night of the tour received scathing reviews , mostly aimed at Carey 's deemed " obvious " stage @-@ <unk> and failure to make a connection with the crowd . <unk> nights were more favorably reviewed , with critics raving about Carey 's vocals . Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote regarding Carey 's live vocals , " Beyond any doubt , Ms. Carey 's voice is no studio <unk> . Her range extends from a rich , <unk> alto to dog @-@ whistle high notes ; she can linger over sensual turns , <unk> with <unk> confidence , <unk> like a <unk> singer . " However , after the strong media attention , Carey did not visit the US on her succeeding Daydream World Tour in 1996 , visiting only Europe and Asia . The tour in contrast , received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike , as well as breaking ticket sale records . Carey 's three shows at Japan 's largest stadium , Tokyo <unk> , sold out in under three hours , <unk> in over 150 @,@ 000 tickets , setting the record of fastest show <unk> in Japan 's history . On the Butterfly World Tour , Carey broke the record , selling 200 @,@ 000 tickets in under one hour . During 1997 , after the commercially and critically successful release of Butterfly , Carey had not planned to tour once again , due to the long travel times and strain on her voice . However , due to overwhelming demand by fans , Carey agreed to perform in Asia once again , only extending the tour to Taiwan and Australia , as well as one last show in the United States . <unk> for the show began shortly after Christmas 1997 , extending for a period of two weeks .

 The show began with Carey standing on a small elevated centerpiece on stage , surrounded by several long draped <unk> . Carey featured three background vocalists throughout the tour , Trey Lorenz , <unk> Daniels and Kelly Price . As the introduction began with " <unk> " , each of the <unk> were slowly draped , revealing Carey atop the platform , dressed in a beige mini @-@ dress and matching sheer <unk> and <unk> heels . As she began performing " <unk> " , the platform was lowered so Carey could access the other sections of the stage throughout the song 's performance . After an intimate performance with <unk> lights for " The Roof ( Back in Time ) " , Carey was joined on @-@ stage by a Peruvian guitar player , who played the Latin @-@ inspired guitar melodies during her performance of " My All " . Afterwards , Carey sang " Close My Eyes " , the only sitting performance of the show . During the song , several male backup dancers performed slow and ample dance routines behind Carey on a higher level of the stage . 
 For the second part of the show , Carey had the second costume change of the evening , donning a long <unk> black gown and semi @-@ <unk> hair . For the performance of " <unk> " , Carey was joined by three female back @-@ up dancers , who mimicked her light dance routines during the song . The next song on the set @-@ list was " Hero " , which featured Carey alone on @-@ stage , without any vocal back @-@ up . After the song 's performance , Carey was joined on @-@ stage by Lorenz , who performed " I 'll Be There " alongside her . Next came " Make It <unk> " , a song which accompanied yet another wardrobe change for Carey . She <unk> a short mini @-@ skirt , alongside a <unk> white <unk> and loose golden <unk> . On @-@ stage , Carey was joined by a full church choir , all dressed in long black garments . After the song 's <unk> , Carey performed " One Sweet Day " , alongside a previously recorded video of Boyz II Men during their live performance of the song with Carey at Madison Square Garden in 1995 . 
 After completing the song , Carey changed to a pair of leg @-@ hugging blue <unk> and a tank top . Her next performance was the " Fantasy " remix , featuring <unk> ' Dirty <unk> on a large projection screen behind the stage , as Carey performed light chair dance @-@ routines alongside several male dancers . The performance featured the most intricate choreography Carey performed on the tour . After a low @-@ key performance of " <unk> " , or " Whenever You Call " in other countries , Carey was once again joined by several male dancers , as she sang " <unk> " , while re @-@ <unk> the music video during a small <unk> . Carey once again changed to a beige ensemble similar to her first outfit before performing her debut single , " Vision of Love " . The final song on the tour was " Butterfly " , which featured large <unk> of butterflies and flowers projected onto the large screen behind Carey . She <unk> a long brown <unk> gown for the performance , being joined on stage once again by her trio of back @-@ up singers . During the shows in Japan , Carey performed her holiday classic " All I Want for Christmas Is You " , alongside various male and female dancers on stage who performed light dance routines alongside Carey .

 <unk> <unk> , also known as Button 's Mill is a Grade II * listed tower mill constructed of brick . The <unk> is located at <unk> , Suffolk , England . It was built in the early nineteenth century to grind wheat into flour . <unk> <unk> worked by wind power until 1924 , <unk> on two sails , after which it became <unk> . 
 In 1979 , a group of enthusiasts purchased <unk> <unk> for restoration . Numerous volunteers helped to restore the mill to full working order over an eight @-@ year period . The mill is open to the public , and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site . 
 The mill is a small four storey tower mill with Patent sails and <unk> by a <unk> . It drives two pairs of <unk> , with a third pair driven by an auxiliary engine . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 The <unk> at <unk> was built by <unk> George <unk> for William Button in 1819 . It replaced a post mill which had been moved to Sandy Lane , <unk> , Norfolk the previous year . The mill was set to work on Christmas Day 1819 . In 1832 , the mill was modernised by the fitting of a cast @-@ iron <unk> , Patent sails and a <unk> . The new <unk> was fitted on 16 July 1832 . It was made by J <unk> , the Kings Lynn <unk> , and weighs 1 <unk> tons ( 1 @,@ 780 kg ) . A new stock was fitted in September 1836 . William Button died on 11 February 1837 . The mill passed jointly to his widow Rebecca and their son Richard . Richard Button worked the mill until 1860 , at which date it was conveyed to his sons Richard and William , who sold it to Richard <unk> from <unk> , Norfolk in 1862 . 
 The mill was worked by Stephen <unk> , Richard 's son . He inherited the mill on the death of his father in 1875 and leased it to Henry Bryant in 1879 . In 1884 , the mill was sold by auction , and Henry Bryant purchased the <unk> . Bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill . From 1892 , a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power , driving an extra pair of <unk> on the ground floor . This was replaced in 1914 by a <unk> oil engine . Bryant ran the mill until 1920 when he sold it to <unk> Vincent , a retired <unk> from <unk> , Norfolk . The <unk> engine was sold in the early 1920s . The mill was <unk> <unk> , and as a result one pair of sails was removed . Vincent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in 1924 . One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when the mill was again <unk> . 
 On the death of <unk> Vincent in 1932 , his son George inherited the property . He lived at the site in an old <unk> until his death in 1973 . The mill passed to his daughter , who sold it in 1974 to Mr and Mrs <unk> , who intended to convert it into a house . They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration . In 1976 , the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale . <unk> <unk> was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979 , and plans for restoration were made . The consortium consisted of Mark <unk> , Charles <unk> , Peter <unk> , David <unk> and Chris <unk> . The <unk> mill and an acre of land cost £ 6 @,@ 000 .

 The mill was restored over a period of six years . Much of the work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair the mill . 
 
 = = = 1979 – 1980 = = = 
 
 The consortium took possession of the mill in November 1979 . The first priority was to make the mill as <unk> as possible . <unk> sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure . The mill was surveyed and recorded . In spring 1980 , the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure . <unk> was erected to allow the <unk> to be dismantled , and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame . 
 A two @-@ week work @-@ in was held at the end of July and beginning of August 1980 . Thirty @-@ three volunteers worked on the mill over the work @-@ in . Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from <unk> of pitch pine which had previously been in a <unk> at Bury St <unk> . On 3 August 1980 , the <unk> and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane , followed by the cap frame and the cast @-@ iron curb sections . 
 New oak <unk> were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower . The bin floor was removed , apart from one oak main beam which was <unk> . A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine , and the oak beam was repaired . New oak <unk> were fitted , along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused . One of these had previously been a whip from a Common sail . Some of the <unk> were made from pitch pine from the <unk> <unk> , which , following its collapse on 19 February 1977 , had been re @-@ erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life , <unk> . The <unk> hoist was dismantled to enable its repair , brickwork was repaired , and new <unk> were made for some of the windows . A <unk> was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter . The <unk> on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of <unk> was removed . 
 The work was financed by grants of £ 500 from the Council for the Preservation of Rural Essex , £ 250 from St <unk> Borough Council , £ 200 from the <unk> Trust , and £ 200 from the Suffolk Mills Group . Other donations and income amounted to £ 65 , with the balance of expenditure being met jointly by the five owners . 
 The " work @-@ in " was reported in both local and national media , including BBC Look East , Bury Free Press , Eastern Daily Press , East Anglian Daily Times , Daily Telegraph , and Radio Orwell . 
 
 = = = 1981 = = = 
 
 In the 1981 season two separate work @-@ ins were held , the first from 25 July to 2 August and the second from 22 August to 30 August . A total of 37 volunteers participated over the two weeks . 
 The <unk> were removed from the stone floor , which was then repaired . One of the main beams was found to have been attacked by Death Watch beetles , and over a third of the <unk> beam was replaced with oak . The six supports for the <unk> frame were repaired one at a time , as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above . One post required replacement . It had <unk> and the floor had sunk by 4 inches ( 100 mm ) causing the second main floor beam to fracture . When this work had been completed , the stone floor was removed , including the second main floor beam , which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed . 
 The new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was <unk> . The stone floor was reconstructed , reusing the old stone bearers and those <unk> that were fit for reuse . Other <unk> were made new from oak or pitch pine . New <unk> were laid in the dust floor , the 1 1 ⁄ 4 inches ( 32 mm ) thick <unk> boards being double @-@ grooved with a metal tongue between them . Those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration . The top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them , aided by a <unk> attached to the upright shaft . 
 During the second work @-@ in , the remainder of the stone floor was boarded , again using double @-@ grooved boards with a metal tongue between them . The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued . The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks . The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete <unk> cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted . The <unk> , the curb segments and <unk> <unk> were given two coats of red lead paint . A new <unk> for the cap was made from a piece of oak 3 feet ( 910 mm ) long by 16 inches ( 410 mm ) diameter . A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and <unk> with <unk> mortar . 
 After the work @-@ in had finished , the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn . The work done in 1981 cost £ 3 @,@ 250 . <unk> received were £ 2 @,@ 000 from <unk> <unk> , £ 1 @,@ <unk> from the Historic Buildings Council and £ 130 from St <unk> Borough Council . Other donations and income received amounted to £ 70 . The project received further coverage in local media , the Eastern Daily Press , and South Norfolk News .

 The 1982 work @-@ ins took place from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August . The work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower , installation of the <unk> curb , a start on the construction of the new cap , installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows . The cap frame was constructed , incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused . The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982 . It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the <unk> into position .

 Work in the early part of 1983 was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various <unk> and overhaul of the various parts of the <unk> <unk> and mechanism for controlling the Patent sails . The mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits , including one from the Wind and <unk> Section of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . Other work included the overhaul of the final drive to the 4 feet 7 inches ( 1 @.@ 40 m ) stones , including <unk> the stone nut and replacement of three <unk> in beech . 
 When the weather improved , work commenced outside . The cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work @-@ in commenced . The work @-@ ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August , with 35 people participating . During the first work @-@ in , the <unk> posts and <unk> were fitted . The oak cap ribs , which had been prefabricated <unk> were fitted and the <unk> was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting . <unk> <unk> of oak were fitted and the <unk> was pulled into position using a <unk> . The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and <unk> . The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time . 
 Between the two work @-@ ins , the rear <unk> was completed and the fitting of <unk> to the cap frame completed . This enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the Monday of the second work @-@ in . The boards for the cap are ½ inch ( 13 mm ) thick and 9 inches ( 230 mm ) wide at the <unk> , <unk> towards the top . A new neck bearing was installed under the <unk> , not without difficulty and much <unk> before it would fit . When the boarding of the cap was completed , the cover strips were fitted over the joints . The <unk> was drawn into position using a rope and <unk> , and the <unk> steel reinforcing band <unk> into position , producing a <unk> structure . The striking rod was fitted through the <unk> and the axle for the <unk> fitted in position on top of the <unk> posts . At the top of the mill tower , the curb was prepared to accept the cap , and the cast iron curb track plates <unk> into position . <unk> of the brickwork of the tower continued , with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work @-@ in . 
 After the work @-@ ins had ended , work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift @-@ on in October . The weather hampered the work initially , but the application of a modern <unk> paint , designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain <unk> , was completed in time for the lift @-@ on . A mini work @-@ in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted , with 17 people participating over the weekend . Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill . The <unk> was removed and the <unk> dismantled . The 5 @-@ ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983 , watched by a crowd of some 70 people . The fitting of the cap was <unk> with beer from <unk> <unk> , <unk> . 
 Restoration work in 1983 cost £ 1 @,@ <unk> . Grants were received from the Association of Independent Museums , <unk> ' Norton Women 's Institute , Ipswich Historical Transport Society , the National Association for <unk> Children , Mr D. Porter and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . Further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by <unk> <unk> .

 Four work @-@ ins were held during 1984 . The first two were by <unk> from Eastern Electricity Board . <unk> <unk> was chosen at the project to benefit from the Young Person 's Development Project for that year . <unk> <unk> had previously benefited from the project , and its owners , the Suffolk Preservation Trust , had suggested that <unk> <unk> would be a good candidate for the scheme . Two separate parties spent a week each at the mill . A <unk> electricity supply was provided . An underground cable was laid with assistance from British Telecom who were <unk> a thrust <unk> which had been developed at their research facility at <unk> Heath . The thrust <unk> laid 25 yards ( 23 m ) of <unk> through which the <unk> cable was pulled into position . The mill was then supplied with lights and <unk> on each floor . 
 Other work undertaken by the <unk> involved repairing some <unk> damage to the foundation brickwork , digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position . A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture , leading to rising <unk> . A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem . A 21 horsepower ( 16 kW ) <unk> & <unk> <unk> diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane . After fitting it was then painted . Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary . 
 Off @-@ site , the new brake wheel and <unk> were made . The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair , and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819 . The original brake wheel was 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their <unk> speed . When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill , as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails . The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter . The brake wheel was also rebuilt , with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original <unk> , resulting in a wheel 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 @.@ 18 m ) in diameter . The opinion of professional <unk> was sought , and it was decided that a scaled @-@ up version of the original brake wheel would be made , but retaining the cast iron teeth segments . The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill . The original iron segments were all broken , so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat @-@ treated malleable cast iron . When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for <unk> . 
 The <unk> was made . Some of the small <unk> were replaced . The stocks were made from pitch pine and the <unk> from Douglas fir . Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows , with only one window still needing attention when the first work @-@ in began . New beech <unk> were fitted to the crown wheel , which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft . 
 The stocks and sails were made during the two work @-@ ins held in July and August , a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks . A second @-@ hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill , but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use . Thus two new stocks were required instead of one . Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and <unk> grounds , leaving two options . Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber , or <unk> stocks . Good quality pitch pine was not <unk> in the lengths required . Douglas fir was <unk> in such lengths but was discounted on strength and <unk> grounds . A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had <unk> after only seven years . Thus it was decided that <unk> stocks would be made . 
 The 52 feet ( 15 @.@ 85 m ) long stocks were made from Douglas fir . All timber had been pressure treated with <unk> and well <unk> . It was estimated that a <unk> stock would be up to 20 % stronger than a similar stock of solid timber . The timber used was 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches ( 38 mm ) thick and nine <unk> were required at the centre , where the stock passes through the poll end of the <unk> . <unk> attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber . Both stocks were made during the work @-@ in , with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use . The stocks were the first <unk> stocks made by amateurs . 
 The four sails were made . The originals being slightly different pairs . Those on the inner stock having bays of 3 feet ( 910 mm ) pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of 3 feet 2 inches ( 970 mm ) pitch . It was decided that the new sails would be identical , at the larger pitch . Four 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 23 m ) long <unk> were cut from a <unk> of pitch pine obtained from a demolished <unk> at Bury St <unk> . The <unk> are 6 inches ( 150 mm ) square at their inner end . <unk> bars and <unk> were made from modern pitch pine , selected for quality . The <unk> for the sail bars were cut . That at the heel of the sail being at 27 ° and that at the tip being 15 ° , decreasing by 1 ½ ° at each sail bar . Three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in . 
 The <unk> and associated <unk> was fitted to the mill . At the end of the second work @-@ in , the cap could be turned by means of the hand <unk> . The <unk> itself , with the <unk> painted red , white and blue was installed shortly afterwards . The <unk> arm brake wheel was assembled around the <unk> . It was found that the <unk> was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch ( 13 mm ) . When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1 / 16 <unk> of an inch ( less than 1 mm ) of true . The <unk> for the stocks were <unk> from a <unk> of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year . Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors , cleaning and painting <unk> and further <unk> on the brickwork . The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work @-@ in . The stock , with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the <unk> and when <unk> in position and the <unk> had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock . The process was repeated for the second pair of sails . The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work @-@ in . 
 Work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail , balancing the <unk> and sorting out <unk> troubles with the <unk> <unk> . The brake and brake lever were made and installed and <unk> <unk> for the sails were cast . 
 Restoration work in 1984 cost £ 2 @,@ 918 . Grants received were £ 1 @,@ <unk> from English Heritage , £ 500 from St <unk> Borough Council , Other donations amounted to £ 52 . <unk> from open days at the mill came to £ 151 . A boost to the funds was £ 2 @,@ 000 from <unk> <unk> . This money had been allocated to allow the moving of a <unk> post mill buck to <unk> . In the end , the removal was not proceeded with , and Mr <unk> allowed the donation to remain with the <unk> Mill Preservation Trust . The project received further support in local media , including the East Anglian Daily Times , one of the work @-@ ins being featured on <unk> Television 's About <unk> programme .

 " <unk> Mouth " was directed by Andrew <unk> , and was written by Walt <unk> , Paul <unk> , and <unk> Williams . <unk> and <unk> also served as storyboard directors , and Carson <unk> , William <unk> and Erik <unk> worked as storyboard artists . Series creator Stephen <unk> has described the episode plot as " a classic thing all kids go through . " Much of the storyline for the episode was inspired by the writers ' own experiences from childhood . The episode originally aired on <unk> in the United States on September 21 , 2001 . The episode marks the introduction of Mr. <unk> ' mother , Mama <unk> , who was voiced by former <unk> <unk> creative producer and current executive producer Paul <unk> . 
 The writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode . The idea for " <unk> Mouth " was inspired by creative director Derek <unk> 's experience " [ when ] I got in trouble for saying the f @-@ word in front of my mother . " <unk> said , " The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. <unk> to <unk> , with <unk> chasing him , is pretty much how it happened in real life . " The end of the episode , where Mr. <unk> uses more <unk> than <unk> and Patrick , was also inspired " by the fact that my [ <unk> 's ] mother has a sailor mouth herself . " 
 The scene where <unk> and Patrick playing a game of <unk> and <unk> , which is a parody of <unk> and <unk> , was difficult for the crew to <unk> , since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location . According to the series ' season 2 DVD commentary , it was planned to have a scene that had <unk> saying " Go ' <unk> noise ' yourself " followed by Patrick saying " ' <unk> noise ' you too ! " during the <unk> and <unk> game . It was removed in the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate for the younger audience . 
 " <unk> Mouth " was released on the DVD compilation called <unk> <unk> : Sea Stories on March 12 , 2002 . It was also included in the <unk> <unk> : The Complete 2nd Season DVD released on October 19 , 2004 .

 According to a report titled Wolves in <unk> 's <unk> , which documents the increase in potentially violent , <unk> , and sexual content in children 's programming , the Parents Television Council , a <unk> media group , and fans believed the <unk> <unk> episode " <unk> Mouth " was an implicit attempt to promote and <unk> use of <unk> among children . The episode originally aired during the 2001 – 02 television season , ironically the season in which the PTC named <unk> <unk> among the best programs on cable television , but the report cited a repeat broadcast of the episode from 2005 to prove its point that it promoted use of <unk> among children . In a later report , several members of the PTC listed " <unk> Mouth " as an example of how levels of <unk> , sexual , and violent activity has increased in children 's television programming . <unk> , in response to the incident , said " It 's sad and a little desperate that they <unk> to literally putting <unk> language in the mouths of our characters to make a point .

 = Military history of Australia = 
 
 The military history of Australia spans the nation 's 220 @-@ year modern history , from the early Australian frontier wars between <unk> and Europeans to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early 21st century . Although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations , Australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars , and war and military service have been significant influences on Australian society and national identity , including the Anzac spirit . The relationship between war and Australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of Australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma . 
 As British <unk> , the Australian colonies participated in Britain 's small wars of the 19th century , while later as a <unk> dominion , and then an independent nation , Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War , as well as in the wars in Korea , Malaya , Borneo and Vietnam during the Cold War . In the Post @-@ Vietnam era Australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions , through the United Nations and other agencies , including in the Sinai , Persian Gulf , <unk> , Somalia , East Timor and the Solomon Islands , while more recently they have also fought as part of multi @-@ lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan . In total , nearly 103 @,@ 000 Australians died during the course of these conflicts . 
 
 = = War and Australian society = = 
 
 For most of the last century military service has been one of the single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males , and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century , it continues to influence Australian society to this day . War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history , while a major part of the national identity has been built on an <unk> conception of the Australian experience of war and of <unk> , known as the Anzac spirit . These ideals include notions of endurance , courage , ingenuity , humour , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; traits which , according to popular thought , defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War . The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity . 
 The relationship between war and Australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture : <unk> with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare . Indeed , Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942 , while since then an alliance with the United States has <unk> its security . <unk> , this pattern of <unk> — both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs , as well as for more <unk> security concerns — has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies . Regardless , a tendency towards strategic <unk> has also been evident , with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to <unk> resources until a crisis arises ; a trait which has historically resulted in <unk> for major military challenges . 
 Reflecting both the realist and liberal <unk> of international relations and the conception of national interests , a number of other important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious . Such themes include : an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics , the <unk> of notions of <unk> sovereignty , a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a <unk> of security , and the proposition that the status <unk> in international affairs should only be changed peacefully . Likewise , <unk> , collective security and defence self @-@ reliance have also been important themes . Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic <unk> have persisted throughout its history , being the product of Australian society 's democratic political tradition and <unk> @-@ Christian Anglo @-@ European heritage , as well its associated values , beliefs and economic , political and religious ideology . These <unk> are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island on the edge of the Asia @-@ Pacific , and the <unk> circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power . To be sure , during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result , it has frequently become involved in foreign wars . Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers — known colloquially as <unk> — have often been noted , somewhat <unk> , for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities .

 = = = British Forces in Australia , 1788 – 1870 = = = 
 
 From 1788 until 1870 the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces . Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island , however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service , known as the New South Wales Corps . The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804 . Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van <unk> 's Land . Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion , a coup mounted by its officers in 1808 . As a result , in January 1810 the 73rd ( <unk> ) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia . By 1870 , 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia , as had a small number of artillery and engineer units . 
 Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack , no actual threat ever <unk> . The British Army was instead used in policing , guarding convicts at penal institutions , combating <unk> , putting down convict rebellions — as occurred at Bathurst in 1830 — and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement . Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the <unk> <unk> in 1854 on the Victorian <unk> . Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India , Afghanistan , New Zealand and the Sudan . 
 During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by detached Royal Navy units of the East Indies Station , based in Sydney . However , in 1859 Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a <unk> , marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia . The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until 1913 , when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy ; the Royal Navy 's depots , dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people . 
 
 = = = Frontier warfare , 1788 – 1934 = = = 
 
 The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied , but were inevitably hostile when the settler 's presence led to competition over resources , and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants ' lands . European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations , and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation . By and large neither the British nor the <unk> approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare . At times , however , the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units . Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands , while many <unk> served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes . 
 Fighting between <unk> and Europeans was localised as the <unk> did not form <unk> capable of sustained resistance . As a result , there was not a single war , but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent . <unk> or disorganised however , a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century . This warfare <unk> the popular and at times academic " myth " of peaceful settlement in Australia . Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence , resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres . Among the most famous is the Battle of <unk> in Western Australia in 1834 . Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however , and after the <unk> Creek massacre in New South Wales in 1838 seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings . However , in Tasmania the so @-@ called Black War was fought between 1828 and 1832 , and aimed at driving most of the island 's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas . Although it began in failure for the British , it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population . 
 It may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly <unk> by Europeans on <unk> . Although many more <unk> died than British , this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans . Aboriginal tactics varied , but were mainly based on pre @-@ existing hunting and fighting practices — using <unk> , clubs and other primitive weapons . Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America , on the main <unk> failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans . Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms , this was not widespread . The <unk> were never a serious military threat to European settlers , regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them . On occasions large groups of <unk> attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued , during which the <unk> would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage . This could sometimes be effective , with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents , waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their <unk> while the settlers <unk> . However , such open warfare usually proved more costly for the <unk> than the Europeans . 
 Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms . However , the advantages afforded by firearms have often been <unk> . Prior to the late 19th century , firearms were often <unk> muzzle @-@ loading , smooth @-@ bore , single shot <unk> with flint @-@ lock mechanisms . Such weapons produced a low rate of fire , while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . These deficiencies may have initially given the <unk> an advantage , allowing them to move in close and engage with <unk> or clubs . Yet by 1850 significant advances in firearms gave the Europeans a distinct advantage , with the six @-@ shot <unk> revolver , the <unk> single shot breech @-@ loading rifle and later the <unk> @-@ Henry rifle , as well as rapid @-@ fire rifles such as the Winchester rifle , becoming available . These weapons , when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of <unk> , often proved successful . The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast @-@ moving , often hidden enemies . Tactics employed included night @-@ time surprise attacks , and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks . 
 The conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed the pattern of British settlement in Australia . Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Europeans in May 1788 , it continued in Sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s . As the frontier moved west so did the conflict , pushing into outback New South Wales in the 1840s . In Tasmania , fighting can be traced from 1804 to the 1830s , while in Victoria and the southern parts of South Australia , the majority of the violence occurred during the 1830s and 1840s . The south @-@ west of Western Australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850 . The war in Queensland began in the area around Brisbane in the 1840s and continued until 1860 , moving to central Queensland in the 1850s and 1860s , and then to northern Queensland from the 1860s to 1900 . In Western Australia , the violence moved north with European settlement , reaching the <unk> region by 1880 , with violent clashes continuing until the 1920s . In the Northern Territory conflict lasted even later still , especially in central Australia , continuing from the 1880s to the 1930s . One estimate of casualties places European deaths at 2 @,@ 500 , while at least 20 @,@ 000 <unk> are believed to have perished . Far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the Aboriginal population by the beginning of the 20th century ; a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist .

Australians were involved in actions at <unk> , <unk> East , <unk> Hill , <unk> and Te <unk> . <unk> than 20 were believed to have been killed in action . The conflict was over by 1864 , and the <unk> Regiments disbanded in 1867 .

 = = = Colonial military forces , 1870 – 1901 = = = 
 
 From 1870 until 1901 , each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence . The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890 , and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs , the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia . To do this , they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces . Initially these were militias in support of British regulars , but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870 , the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities . The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia , paid citizen soldiers , and a small permanent component . They were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline . Even after significant reforms in the 1870s — including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units — they remained too small and <unk> to be considered armies in the modern sense . By 1885 , the forces numbered 21 @,@ 000 men . Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century , with the colonies raising <unk> to serve in Sudan , South Africa and China . 
 Despite a reputation of colonial <unk> , many of the locally raised units were highly organised , disciplined , professional , and well trained . During this period , defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery , based on garrisoned coastal forts . However , by the 1890s , improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards — who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces — to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid <unk> of brigades of infantry . As a consequence he called for a <unk> of defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies . Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be <unk> and for professional units — obliged to serve anywhere in the South Pacific — to replace the volunteer forces . These views found support in the influential New South Wales Commandant , Major General Edward Hutton , however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards New South Wales and Victoria <unk> the proposal . These reforms remaining unresolved however , and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies . 
 With the exception of Western Australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . In 1856 , Victoria received its own naval vessel , <unk> Victoria , and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860 during the First <unk> War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas . The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid @-@ 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo @-@ boats for the defence of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts . Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad <unk> Cerberus in service from 1870 , as well as the steam @-@ sail warship HMS Nelson on loan from the Royal Navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo @-@ boats . New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo @-@ boats and a <unk> . The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in 1885 , while South Australia operated a single ship , HMCS Protector . Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps , while Western Australia 's only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery . Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the <unk> Rebellion in China in 1900 , while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action . The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901 , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia .

 During the early years of the 1880s , an Egyptian regime in the Sudan , backed by the British , came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad ( or Ahmed ) , known as Mahdi to his followers . In 1883 , as part of the <unk> War , the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt , but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of <unk> their forces . The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan , and sent General Charles Gordon to co @-@ <unk> the evacuation , but he was killed in January 1885 . When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885 , the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent 's expenses . The New South Wales <unk> consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers , and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from Sydney on 3 March 1885 . 
 The contingent arrived in <unk> on 29 March and were attached to a brigade that consisted of Scots , <unk> and <unk> Guards . They subsequently marched for <unk> in a large " square " formation made up of 10 @,@ 000 men . Reaching the village , they burned <unk> and returned to <unk> : three Australians were wounded in minor fighting . Most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards <unk> , on the Nile . The Australians were then assigned to guard duties , but soon a camel corps was raised and 50 men volunteered . They <unk> on a reconnaissance to <unk> on 6 May and were heavily involved in a <unk> during which more than 100 Arabs were killed or captured . On 15 May , they made one last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previous March . Meanwhile , the artillery were posted at <unk> and drilled for a month , but they soon rejoined the camp at <unk> . 
 Eventually the British government decided that the campaign in Sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in <unk> . The New South Wales <unk> sailed for home on 17 May , arriving in Sydney on 19 June 1885 . Approximately 770 Australians served in Sudan ; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign . 
 
 = = = Second Boer War , 1899 – 1902 = = = 
 
 British encroachment into areas of South Africa already settled by the <unk> <unk> and the competition for resources and land that developed between them as a result , led to the Second Boer War in 1899 . Pre @-@ <unk> the deployment of British forces , the <unk> <unk> of the Orange Free State and the <unk> Republic under President Paul <unk> declared war on 11 October 1899 , striking deep into the British territories of Natal and the Cape Colony . After the outbreak of war , plans for the dispatch of a combined Australian force were subsequently set aside by the British War Office and each of the six colonial governments sent separate <unk> to serve with British formations , with two squadrons each of 125 men from New South Wales and Victoria , and one each from the other colonies . The first troops arrived three weeks later , with the New South Wales <unk> — who had been training in England before the war , <unk> diverted to South Africa . On 22 November , the <unk> came under fire for the first time near <unk> , and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them . 
 Following a series of minor victories , the British suffered a major setback during Black Week between 10 – 17 December 1899 , although no Australian units were involved . The first <unk> of infantry from Victoria , South Australia , Western Australia , and Tasmania arrived in Cape Town on 26 November and were designated the Australian Regiment under the command of Colonel John Charles <unk> . With a need for increased mobility , they were soon converted into mounted infantry . Further units from Queensland and New South Wales arrived in December and were soon committed to the front . The first casualties occurred soon after at <unk> on 1 January 1900 , after 250 Queensland Mounted Infantry and a column of Canadians , British and artillery attacked a Boer <unk> at <unk> . <unk> David <unk> and Victor Jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the Boer forward <unk> . Regardless , the <unk> were surprised and during two hours of heavy fighting , more than 50 were killed and another 40 taken prisoner . Five hundred <unk> and the New South Wales <unk> subsequently took part in the Siege of <unk> in February 1900 . 
 Despite serious set @-@ backs at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in January — and with <unk> still under siege — the British mounted a five division counter @-@ invasion of the Orange Free State in February . The attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General John French with the New South Wales <unk> , Queensland Mounted Infantry and New South Wales Army Medical Corps attached . First , <unk> was relieved following the battles of <unk> River and <unk> , and the retreating <unk> defeated at <unk> , with the New South Wales Mounted Rifles locating the Boer general , <unk> <unk> . The British entered <unk> on 13 March 1900 , while <unk> was relieved . Disease began to take its toll and scores of men died . Still the advance continued , with the drive to <unk> in May including more than 3 @,@ 000 Australians . Johannesburg fell on 30 May , and the <unk> withdrew from <unk> on 3 June . The New South Wales Mounted Rifles and Western Australians saw action again at Diamond Hill on 12 June . <unk> was relieved on 17 May . 
 Following the defeat of the <unk> republics still the <unk> held out , forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt British troop movements and lines of supply . This new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the Australian colonies and the raising of the <unk> 's <unk> , with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse @-@ riding and shooting skills , but little military experience . After Federation in 1901 , eight Australian Commonwealth Horse battalions of the newly created Australian Army were also sent to South Africa , although they saw little fighting before the war ended . Some Australians later joined local South African irregular units , instead of returning home after discharge . These soldiers were part of the British Army , and were subject to British military discipline . Such units included the <unk> <unk> which gained notoriety as the unit in which Harry " <unk> " <unk> and Peter <unk> served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes . 
 With the guerrillas requiring supplies , <unk> de la Rey lead a force of 3 @,@ 000 <unk> against <unk> , on the <unk> River in Western <unk> . The post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 Australians and 200 <unk> . The attack began on 4 August 1900 with heavy shelling causing 32 casualties . During the night the defenders dug in , enduring shelling and rifle fire . A relief force was stopped by the <unk> , while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved . The siege lasted 11 days , during which more than 1 @,@ 800 shells were fired into the post . After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders , and not prepared to risk a frontal attack , the <unk> eventually retired . The Siege of <unk> River was one of the major achievements of the Australians during the war , with the post finally relieved on 16 August . 
 In response the British adopted counter @-@ insurgency tactics , including a <unk> earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops , the establishment of concentration camps for Boer women and children , and a system of <unk> and field obstacles to limit Boer mobility and to protect railway communications . Such measures required considerable expenditure , and caused much bitterness towards the British , however they soon yielded results . By mid @-@ 1901 , the bulk of the fighting was over , and British mounted units would ride at night to attack Boer <unk> or <unk> , overwhelming them with superior numbers . <unk> of warfare in last months of 1901 , the New South Wales Mounted Rifles travelled 1 @,@ <unk> miles ( 2 @,@ <unk> km ) and were involved in 13 <unk> , killing 27 <unk> , wounding 15 , and capturing 196 for the loss of five dead and 19 wounded . Other notable Australian actions included <unk> , Pink Hill , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Australians were not always successful however , suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war . On 12 June 1901 , the 5th Victorian Mounted Rifles lost 19 killed and 42 wounded at <unk> , near <unk> after poor security allowed a force of 150 <unk> to surprise them . On 30 October 1901 , <unk> of the Scottish Horse Regiment also suffered heavy casualties at Gun Hill , although 60 <unk> were also killed in the engagement . Meanwhile , at <unk> on 4 January 1902 , the 5th Queensland Imperial <unk> lost 13 killed and 17 wounded . Ultimately the <unk> were defeated , and the war ended on 31 May 1902 . In all 16 @,@ 175 Australians served in South Africa , and perhaps another 10 @,@ 000 enlisted as individuals in Imperial units ; casualties included 251 killed in action , 267 died of disease and 43 missing in action , while a further 735 were wounded . Six Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross . 
 
 = = = <unk> Rebellion , 1900 – 01 = = = 
 
 The <unk> Rebellion in China began in 1900 , and a number of western nations — including many European powers , the United States , and Japan — soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests . In June , the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China . The colonies also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa , they had to rely on naval forces for manpower . The force dispatched was a modest one , with Britain accepting 200 men from Victoria , 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector , under the command of Captain William <unk> . Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade <unk> , who had been trained in both ship handling and <unk> to fulfil their coastal defence role . Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks , Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War . The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors , while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks . The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the <unk> Marine Light Infantry . 
 The <unk> from New South Wales and Victoria sailed for China on 8 August 1900 . Arriving in <unk> , the Australians provided 300 men to an 8 @,@ 000 @-@ strong multinational force tasked with capturing the Chinese forts at <unk> Tang , which dominated a key railway . They arrived too late to take part in the battle , but were involved in the attack on the fortress at <unk> @-@ <unk> Fu , where the Chinese government was believed to have found <unk> after <unk> was captured by western forces . The <unk> joined a force of 7 @,@ 500 men on a ten @-@ day march to the fort , once again only to find that it had already surrendered . The <unk> then garrisoned <unk> and the New South Wales contingent undertook garrison duties in <unk> . HMCS Protector was mostly used for survey , transport , and <unk> duties in the Gulf of <unk> , before departing in November . The naval brigades remained during the winter , <unk> performing policing and guard duties , as well as working as <unk> and fire @-@ fighters . They left China in March 1901 , having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order . Six Australians died from sickness and injury , but none were killed as a result of enemy action . 
 
 = = Australian military forces at Federation , 1901 = = 
 
 The Commonwealth of Australia came into existence on 1 January 1901 as a result of the federation of the Australian colonies . Under the Constitution of Australia , defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government . The co @-@ ordination of Australia @-@ wide defensive efforts in the face of Imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean was one of driving forces behind <unk> , and the Department of Defence immediately came into being as a result , while the Commonwealth Military Forces ( early forerunner of the Australian Army ) and Commonwealth Naval Force were also soon established . 
 The Australian Commonwealth Military Forces came into being on 1 March 1901 and all the colonial forces — including those still in South Africa — became part of the new force . 28 @,@ <unk> colonial soldiers , including 1 @,@ 457 professional soldiers , 18 @,@ 603 paid militia and 8 @,@ <unk> unpaid volunteers , were subsequently transferred . The individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts until the Defence Act 1903 brought all the units under one piece of legislation . This Act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside Australia . However , the majority of soldiers remained in militia units , known as the Citizen Military Forces ( <unk> ) . Major General Sir Edward Hutton — a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces — subsequently became the first commander of the Commonwealth Military Forces on 26 December and set to work <unk> an integrated structure for the new army . In 1911 , following a report by Lord <unk> the Royal Military College , <unk> was established , as was a system of universal National Service . 
 Prior to federation each self @-@ governing colony had operated its own naval force . These navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities , forcing the separate colonies to <unk> the cost of a British naval squadron in their waters for decades . The colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901 , when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created . This new force also lacked blue water capable ships , and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy . In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and <unk> , while attending the Imperial Conference in London , sought the British Government 's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy . The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge , but suggested <unk> that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient . Deakin was unimpressed , and in 1908 invited the American Great White Fleet to visit Australia . This visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700 @-@ ton River @-@ class destroyers . The surge in German naval construction prompted the Admiralty to change their position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in 1911 , absorbing the Commonwealth Naval Force . On 4 October 1913 , the new fleet steamed through Sydney Heads , consisting of the battlecruiser <unk> Australia , three light cruisers , and three destroyers , while several other ships were still under construction . And as a consequence the navy entered the First World War as a formidable force . 
 The Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) was established as part of the Commonwealth Military Forces in 1912 , prior to the formation of the Australian Military Forces in 1916 and was later separated in 1921 to form the Royal Australian Air Force , making it the second oldest air force in the world . Regardless , the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however , and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments .

 When Britain declared war on Germany at the start of the First World War , the Australian government rapidly followed suit , with Prime Minister Joseph Cook declaring on 5 August 1914 that " ... when the Empire is at war , so also is Australia " and reflecting the sentiment of many Australians that any declaration of war by Britain automatically included Australia . This was itself in part due to the large number of British @-@ born citizens and first generation Anglo @-@ Australians that made up the Australian population at the time . Indeed , by the end of the war almost 20 % of those who served in the Australian forces had been born in Britain . 
 As the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 , an all @-@ volunteer expeditionary force known as the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) was formed and recruitment began on 10 August 1914 . The government pledged 20 @,@ 000 men , organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units . <unk> and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under <unk> plans drawn up in 1912 . The first commander was Major General William Bridges , who also assumed command of the 1st Division . Throughout the course of the conflict Australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war , although small air and naval forces were also committed . 
 
 = = = Occupation of German New Guinea = = = 
 
 Following the outbreak of war Australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of Germany 's Pacific colonies . The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force ( <unk> & <unk> ) , a 2000 @-@ man volunteer force — separate from the AIF — and consisting of an infantry battalion plus 500 naval <unk> and ex @-@ sailors , was rapidly formed under the command of William Holmes . The objectives of the force were the wireless stations on <unk> , and those at Yap in the Caroline Islands , and at Rabaul in German New Guinea . The force reached Rabaul on 11 September 1914 and occupied it the next day , encountering only brief resistance from the German and native defenders during fighting at <unk> <unk> and <unk> . German New Guinea surrendered on 17 September 1914 . Australian losses were light , including six killed during the fighting , but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore of the submarine <unk> with all 35 men aboard . 
 
 = = = Gallipoli = = = 
 
 The AIF departed by ship in a single convoy from Albany on 1 November 1914 . During the journey one of the convoy 's naval escorts — <unk> Sydney — engaged and destroyed the German cruiser SMS <unk> at the Battle of <unk> on 8 November , in the first ship @-@ to @-@ ship action involving the Royal Australian Navy . Although originally bound for England to undergo further training and then for employment on the Western Front , the Australians were instead sent to British @-@ controlled Egypt to pre @-@ <unk> any Turkish attack against the strategically important Suez Canal , and with a view to opening another front against the Central Powers . 
 <unk> to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious <unk> at Gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British , Indian and French forces committed to the campaign . The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) — commanded by British general William Birdwood — subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915 . Although promising to transform the war if successful , the Gallipoli Campaign was ill @-@ conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate , without achieving its objectives . Australian casualties totalled 26 @,@ 111 , including 8 @,@ 141 killed . 
 For Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity . Today , the date of the initial landings , 25 April , is known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations , as well as Turkey , to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original <unk> , and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war . 
 
 = = = Egypt and Palestine = = = 
 
 After the withdrawal from Gallipoli the Australians returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion . In 1916 the infantry began to move to France while the cavalry units remained in the Middle East to fight the Turks . Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign , playing a pivotal role in fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt . The Australian 's first saw combat during the <unk> uprising in the <unk> Desert and the Nile Valley , during which the combined British forces successfully put down the primitive pro @-@ Turkish Islamic sect with heavy casualties . The Anzac Mounted Division subsequently saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani against the Turkish between 3 – 5 August 1916 , with the Turks eventually pushed back . Following this victory the British forces went on the offensive in the Sinai , although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the Suez Canal . Rafa was captured on 9 January 1917 , while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in the Sinai were eliminated in February . 
 The advance entered Palestine and an initial , unsuccessful attempt was made to capture Gaza on 26 March 1917 , while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on 19 April . A third assault occurred between 31 October and 7 November and this time both the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division took part . The battle was a complete success for the British , over @-@ running the Gaza @-@ Beersheba line and capturing 12 @,@ 000 Turkish soldiers . The critical moment was the capture of Beersheba on the first day , after the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade charged more than 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) . The Turkish trenches were overrun , with the Australians capturing the wells at <unk> and securing the valuable water they contained along with over 700 prisoners for the loss of 31 killed and 36 wounded . Later , Australian troops assisted in pushing the Turkish forces out of Palestine and took part in actions at <unk> Ridge , Jerusalem and the <unk> . The Turkish government surrendered on 30 October 1918 . Units of the Light Horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in Egypt in 1919 and did so with efficiency and brutality , although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process . 
 Meanwhile , the AFC had undergone remarkable development , and its independence as a separate national force was unique among the <unk> . <unk> just a single aircraft to German New Guinea in 1914 , the first operational flight did not occur until 27 May 1915 however , when the <unk> Half Flight was called upon to assist in protecting British oil interests in Iraq . The AFC was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw action in Egypt , Palestine and on the Western Front , where they performed well . 
 
 = = = Western Front = = = 
 
 Five infantry divisions of the AIF saw action in France and Belgium , leaving Egypt in March 1916 . I Anzac Corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of <unk> on 7 April 1916 and for the next two and a half years the AIF participated in most of the major battles on the Western Front , earning a formidable reputation . Although spared from the disastrous first day of the Battle of the Somme , within weeks four Australian divisions had been committed . The 5th Division , positioned on the left flank , was the first in action during the Battle of <unk> on 19 July 1916 , suffering 5 @,@ 533 casualties in a single day . The 1st Division entered the line on 23 July , assaulting <unk> , and by the time that they were relieved by the 2nd Division on 27 July , they had suffered 5 @,@ 286 casualties . Mouquet Farm was attacked in August , with casualties totalling 6 @,@ 300 men . By the time the AIF was withdrawn from the Somme to re @-@ organise , they had suffered 23 @,@ 000 casualties in just 45 days . 
 In March 1917 , the 2nd and 5th Divisions pursued the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line , capturing the town of <unk> . On 11 April , the 4th Division assaulted the Hindenburg Line in the disastrous First Battle of <unk> , losing over 3 @,@ 000 casualties and 1 @,@ 170 captured . On 15 April , the 1st and 2nd Divisions were counter @-@ attacked near <unk> and were forced to abandon the town , before <unk> it again . The 2nd Division then took part in the Second Battle of <unk> , beginning on 3 May , and succeeded in taking sections of the Hindenburg Line and holding them until relieved by the 1st Division . Finally , on 7 May the 5th Division relieved the 1st , remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid @-@ May . Combined these efforts cost 7 @,@ <unk> Australian casualties . 
 On 7 June 1917 , the II Anzac Corps — along with two British corps — launched an operation in Flanders to eliminate a salient south of Ypres . The attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds ( 454 @,@ 545 kg ) of explosives that had been placed underneath the <unk> ridge , destroying the German trenches . The advance was virtually unopposed , and despite strong German counterattacks the next day , it succeeded . Australian casualties during the Battle of <unk> included nearly 6 @,@ 800 men . I Anzac Corps then took part in the Third Battle of Ypres in Belgium as part of the campaign to capture the <unk> Plateau , between September and November 1917 . Individual actions took place at <unk> Road , <unk> Wood , <unk> , <unk> and Passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks fighting the Australians suffered 38 @,@ 000 casualties . 
 On 21 March 1918 the German Army launched its Spring Offensive in a last @-@ <unk> effort to win the war , <unk> sixty @-@ three divisions over a 70 miles ( 110 km ) front . As the Allies fell back the 3rd and 4th Divisions were rushed south to Amiens on the Somme . The offensive lasted for the next five months and all five AIF divisions in France were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide . By late May the Germans had pushed to within 50 miles ( 80 km ) of Paris . During this time the Australians fought at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> Wood , <unk> , and Hamel . At Hamel the commander of the Australian Corps , Lieutenant General John Monash , successfully used combined arms — including aircraft , artillery and armour — in an attack for the first time . 
 The German offensive ground to a halt in mid @-@ July and a brief lull followed , during which the Australians undertook a series of raids , known as <unk> <unk> . The Allies soon launched their own offensive — the Hundred Days Offensive — ultimately ending the war . Beginning on 8 August 1918 the offensive included four Australian divisions striking at Amiens . Using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at Hamel , significant gains were made on what became known as the " Black Day " of the German Army . The offensive continued for four months , and during Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Mont St Quentin , before their final engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at <unk> . The AIF was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on 11 November 1918 . 
 In all <unk> @,@ <unk> Australians enlisted in the AIF during the war and 333 @,@ 000 served overseas . 61 @,@ 508 were killed and another 155 @,@ 000 were wounded ( a total casualty rate of 65 % ) . The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £ <unk> @,@ <unk> @,@ <unk> . Two <unk> on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war , preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force , but stretching the reserves of manpower available , particularly towards the end of the fighting . Consequently , Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war . 
 The war had a profound effect on Australian society in other ways also . Indeed , for many Australians the nation 's involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor , while many of the notions of Australian character and <unk> that exist today have their origins in the war . 64 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War .

 The Russian Civil War began after the Russian provisional government collapsed and the <unk> party assumed power in October 1917 . Following the end of the First World War , the western powers — including Britain — intervened , giving half @-@ hearted support to the pro @-@ <unk> , anti @-@ <unk> White Russian forces . Although the Australian government refused to commit forces , many Australians serving with the British Army became involved in the fighting . A small number served as advisors to White Russian units with the North Russian Expeditionary Force ( <unk> ) . <unk> repatriation in England , about 150 Australians subsequently enlisted in the British North Russia Relief Force ( <unk> ) , where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed . 
 The Royal Australian Navy destroyer <unk> Swan was also briefly engaged , carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea in late 1918 . Other Australians served as advisers with the British Military Mission to the White Russian General , Anton <unk> in South Russia , while several more advised Admiral <unk> <unk> in Siberia . Later , they also served in Mesopotamia as part of <unk> and the <unk> Mission , although these missions were aimed at preventing Turkish access to the Middle East and India , and did little fighting . 
 Although the motivations of those Australian 's that volunteered to fight in Russia can only be guessed at , it seems unlikely to have been political . Regardless , they confirmed a reputation for <unk> and courage , winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign , despite their small numbers . Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome of the war . Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded , with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia .

 A small number of Australian volunteers fought on both sides of the Spanish Civil War , although they predominantly supported the Spanish Republic through the International Brigades . The Australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions of other <unk> , such as the British Battalion and the Lincoln Battalion , rather than forming their own units . Most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons , while a number were Spanish @-@ born migrants who returned to fight in their country of origin . At least 66 Australians volunteered , with only one — <unk> Bull , a conservative <unk> who was later killed serving in the RAF during the Second World War — known to have fought for General Francisco Franco 's Nationalist forces . 
 While a celebrated cause for the Australian left — particularly the Communist Party of Australia and the trade union movement — the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality .

Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries , at least 14 were killed .

 Australia entered the Second World War on 3 September 1939 . At the time of the declaration of war against Germany the Australian military was small and <unk> for war . <unk> for a Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) began in mid @-@ September . While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War , a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid @-@ 1940 . Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940 , three of which were dispatched to the Middle East . The RAAF 's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme ( <unk> ) , through which almost 28 @,@ 000 Australians were trained during the war . 
 The Australian military 's first major engagements of the war were against Italian forces in the Mediterranean and North Africa . During 1940 the light cruiser <unk> Sydney and five elderly destroyers ( dubbed the " <unk> Iron Flotilla " by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels — a title proudly accepted by the ships ) took part in a series of operations as part of the British Mediterranean Fleet , and sank several Italian warships . The Army first saw action in January 1941 , when the 6th Division formed part of the Commonwealth forces during Operation <unk> . The division assaulted and captured <unk> on 5 January and <unk> on 22 January , with tens of thousands of Italian troops surrendering at both towns . The 6th Division took part in the pursuit of the Italian Army and captured <unk> on 4 February . In late February it was withdrawn for service in Greece , and was replaced by the 9th Division . 
 The Australian forces in the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941 . During April , the 6th Division , other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece . At the end of this campaign , the 6th Division was evacuated to Egypt and Crete . The force at Crete subsequently fought in the Battle of Crete during May , which also ended in defeat for the Allies . Over 5 @,@ 000 Australians were captured in these campaigns , and the 6th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat . The Germans and Italians also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near the border with Egypt . The 9th Division and a brigade of the 7th Division were besieged at <unk> ; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by British units in October . During June , the main body of the 7th Division , a brigade of the 6th Division and the I Corps headquarters took part in the Syria @-@ Lebanon Campaign against the <unk> French . Resistance was stronger than expected ; Australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the French <unk> in early July . 
 The majority of Australian units in the Mediterranean returned to Australia in early 1942 , after the outbreak of the Pacific War . The 9th Division was the largest unit to remain in the Middle East , and played a key role in the First Battle of El <unk> during June and the Second Battle of El <unk> in October . The division returned to Australia in early 1943 , but several RAAF squadrons and <unk> warships took part in the subsequent Tunisia Campaign and the Italian Campaign from 1943 until the end of the war . 
 The RAAF 's role in the strategic air offensive in Europe formed Australia 's main contribution to the defeat of Germany . Approximately 13 @,@ 000 Australian airmen served in dozens of British and five Australian squadrons in RAF <unk> Command between 1940 and the end of the war . Australians took part in all of <unk> Command 's major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France . Australian aircrew in <unk> Command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the Australian military during the Second World War and sustained almost 20 percent of all Australian deaths in combat ; 3 @,@ 486 were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner . Australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of Western Europe during 1944 and 1945 and two RAAF maritime patrol squadrons served in the Battle of the Atlantic . 
 
 = = = Asia and the Pacific = = = 
 
 From the 1920s Australia 's defence thinking was dominated by British Imperial defence policy , which was embodied by the " Singapore strategy " . This strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at Singapore from which a large British fleet would respond to Japanese aggression in the region . To this end , a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan increased . However , as a result of the emphasis on co @-@ operation with Britain , relatively few Australian military units had been retained in Australia and the Asia @-@ Pacific region . Measures were taken to improve Australia 's defences as war with Japan <unk> in 1941 , but these proved inadequate . In December 1941 , the Australian Army in the Pacific comprised the 8th Division , most of which was stationed in Malaya , and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia . The RAAF was equipped with 373 aircraft , most of which were obsolete trainers , and the <unk> had three cruisers and two destroyers in Australian waters . 
 The Australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the Pacific War . The 8th Division and RAAF squadrons in Malaya formed a part of the British Commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller Japanese invasion force which landed on 7 December . The British Commonwealth force withdrew to Singapore at the end of January , but was forced to surrender on 15 February after the Japanese captured much of the island . Smaller Australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early 1942 at Rabaul , and in Ambon , Timor , and Java . The Australian town of Darwin was heavily bombed by the Japanese on 19 February , to prevent it from being used as an Allied base . Over 22 @,@ 000 Australians were taken prisoner in early 1942 and endured harsh conditions in Japanese captivity . The prisoners were subjected to <unk> , denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards . As a result , 8 @,@ 296 Australian prisoners died in captivity . 
 The rapid Allied defeat in the Pacific caused many Australians to fear that the Japanese would invade the Australian mainland . While elements of the Imperial Japanese Navy proposed this in early 1942 , it was judged to be impossible by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters , which instead adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , Fiji , Samoa , and New Caledonia . This fact was not known by the Allies at the time , and the Australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion . Large numbers of United States Army and Army Air Forces units arrived in Australia in early 1942 , and the Australian military was placed under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur in March . 
 Australians played a central role in the New Guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943 . After an attempt to land troops at Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea , the Japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay . Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the <unk> Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay with the support of the RAAF and USAAF . Australian and US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard @-@ fought Battle of <unk> @-@ <unk> . The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of <unk> in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the <unk> @-@ Lae campaign in April . In late 1943 , the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation <unk> , when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the <unk> Peninsula during the <unk> Peninsula campaign and <unk> Range campaign . 
 The Australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943 . Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943 . These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New Guinea , but were unsuccessful . Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies ( <unk> ) . 
 Australia 's role in the Pacific War declined from 1944 . The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production . Nevertheless , the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active , and agreed to MacArthur 's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns . In late 1944 , Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea , New Britain , and <unk> , and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there . In May 1945 , I Corps , the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign , which continued until the end of the war . These campaigns contributed little to Japan 's defeat and remain controversial . 
 Following Japan 's surrender on 15 August 1945 Australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of Borneo and the eastern Netherlands East Indies until British and Dutch colonial rule was restored . Australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of Japanese personnel . <unk> @,@ 000 Australians enlisted during the war , while <unk> @,@ 000 served overseas . Casualties included 39 @,@ 767 killed and another 66 @,@ <unk> were wounded . 20 Victoria Crosses were awarded to Australians .

 The <unk> of the Australian military following the end of the Second World War was completed in 1947 . Plans for post @-@ war defence arrangements were <unk> on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force . It was envisioned that the Royal Australian Navy maintaining a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers , two cruisers , six destroyers , 16 others ships in commission and another 52 in reserved . The Royal Australian Air Force would have a strength of 16 squadrons , including four manned by the Citizen Air Force . Meanwhile , in a significant departure from previous Australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces , the Australian Army would include a permanent field force of 19 @,@ 000 regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support , serving alongside a part @-@ time force of 50 @,@ 000 men in the Citizen Military Forces . The Australian Regular Army was subsequently formed on 30 September 1947 , while the <unk> was re @-@ raised on 1 July 1948 . 
 
 = = = Occupation of Japan , 1946 – 52 = = = 
 
 In the immediate post @-@ war period Australia contributed significant forces to the Allied occupation of Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( <unk> ) , which included forces from Australia , Britain , India and New Zealand . At its height in 1946 the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade , four warships and three fighter squadrons , totalling 13 @,@ 500 personnel . The Australian Army component initially consisted of the 34th Brigade which arrived in Japan in February 1946 and was based in <unk> Prefecture . The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st , 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949 , and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948 , forming the basis of the post @-@ war Regular Army . From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under @-@ strength battalion . Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the <unk> ceased operations , although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean <unk> following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 . The RAAF component consisted of Nos. 76 , 77 and 82 Squadrons as part of No. 81 Wing RAAF flying P @-@ 51 Mustangs , initially based at <unk> from March 1946 , before transferring to <unk> in 1948 . However , by 1950 only No. 77 Squadron remained in Japan . A total of ten <unk> warships served in Japan during this period , including <unk> Ships Australia , Hobart , Shropshire , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Murchison , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , while <unk> Ships <unk> , <unk> and <unk> also provided support .

 During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations , or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain . The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces , where they would most likely operate with British forces . Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin <unk> in 1948 – 49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 . Meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army , RAAF and <unk> . 
 
 = = = Korean War , 1950 – 53 = = = 
 
 On 25 June 1950 , the North Korean Army ( KPA ) crossed the border into South Korea and advanced for the capital Seoul , which fell in less than a week . North Korean forces continued toward the port of Pusan and two days later the United States offered its assistance to South Korea . In response the United Nations Security Council requested members to assist in <unk> the North Korean attack . Australia initially contributed P @-@ 51 Mustang fighter @-@ bomber aircraft from No. 77 Squadron RAAF and infantry from the 3rd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 3 RAR ) , both of which were stationed in Japan as part of the <unk> . In addition , it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the British Commonwealth Forces Korea . The <unk> frigate <unk> <unk> , and the destroyer <unk> <unk> , were also committed . Later , an aircraft carrier strike group aboard <unk> Sydney was added to the force . 
 By the time 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September , the North Koreans were in retreat following the <unk> landings . As a part of the invasion force under the UN Supreme Commander , General Douglas MacArthur , the battalion moved north and was involved in its first major action at Battle of <unk> near <unk> on 22 October , before advancing towards the <unk> River . Further successful actions followed at <unk> on 25 – 26 October 1950 and at <unk> on 29 October 1950 . North Korean casualties were heavy , while Australian losses included their commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green , who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 November . Meanwhile , during the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved 18 divisions of the People 's Volunteer Army across the <unk> River to reinforce the remnants of the KPA . <unk> by US and South Korean intelligence , the 13th Army Group crossed the border on 16 October and penetrated up to 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) into North Korea , and were reinforced in early November by 12 divisions from the 9th Army Group ; in total 30 divisions composed of 380 @,@ 000 men . 3 RAR fought its first action against the Chinese at <unk> on 5 November . The fighting cost the battalion heavily and despite halting a Chinese division the new battalion commander was dismissed in the wake . Following the Chinese intervention , the UN forces were defeated in successive battles and 3 RAR was forced to withdraw to the 38th parallel . 
 A series of battles followed at <unk> on 1 – 4 January 1951 , as the British and Australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to secure the northern approaches to the South Korean capital . Further fighting occurred at <unk> @-@ <unk> on 14 – 17 February 1951 following another Chinese advance , and later at <unk> @-@ San between 7 – 12 March 1951 as the UN resumed the offensive . Australian troops subsequently participated in two more major battles in 1951 , with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the Battle of <unk> . On 22 April , Chinese forces attacked the <unk> valley and forced the South Korean defenders to withdraw . Australian and Canadian troops were ordered to halt this Chinese advance . After a night of fighting the Australians recaptured their positions , at the cost of 32 men killed and 59 wounded . In July 1951 , the Australian battalion became part of the combined Canadian , British , Australian , New Zealand , and Indian 1st Commonwealth Division . The second major battle took place during Operation Commando and occurred after the Chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the Imjin River . The 1st Commonwealth Division counter @-@ attacked on 3 October , capturing a number of objectives including Hill 355 and Hill 317 during the Battle of Maryang San ; after five days the Chinese retreated . Australian casualties included 20 dead and 104 wounded . 
 The <unk> then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War , in which men lived in tunnels , redoubts , and <unk> forts behind barbed wire defences . From 1951 until the end of the war , 3 RAR held trenches on the eastern side of the division 's positions in the hills northeast of the Imjin River . Across from them were heavily fortified Chinese positions . In March 1952 , Australia increased its ground commitment to two battalions , sending 1 RAR . This battalion remained in Korea for 12 months , before being replaced by 2 RAR in April 1953 . The Australians fought their last battle during 24 – 26 July 1953 , with 2 RAR holding off a <unk> Chinese attack along the <unk> River and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five killed and 24 wounded . <unk> were suspended on 27 July 1953 . 17 @,@ 808 Australians served during the war , with 341 killed , 1 @,@ 216 wounded and 30 captured . 
 
 = = = Malayan Emergency , 1950 – 60 = = = 
 
 The Malayan Emergency was declared on 18 June 1948 , after three estate managers were murdered by members of the Malayan Communist Party ( <unk> ) . Australian involvement began in June 1950 , when in response to a British request , six <unk> from No. 1 Squadron and a flight of Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron arrived in Singapore to form part of the British Commonwealth Far East Air Force ( <unk> ) . The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs , troop movement , as well as <unk> and <unk> drops , while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist ( CT ) jungle bases . The RAAF were particularly successful , and in one such mission known as Operation <unk> , five Lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps , killed 13 communists and forced one into surrender , in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops . The <unk> were withdrawn in 1958 , and were replaced by Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron and CAC Sabres from No. 78 Wing . Based at RAAF Base <unk> they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas . 
 Australian ground forces were deployed to Malaya in October 1955 as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve . In January 1956 , the first Australian ground forces were deployed on Malaysian peninsula , consisting of the 2nd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 2 RAR ) . 2 RAR mainly participated in " <unk> up " operations over the next 20 months , conducting extensive patrolling in and near the CT jungle bases , as part of 28th British Commonwealth Brigade . Contact with the enemy was <unk> and results small , achieving relatively few kills . 2 RAR left Malaysia October 1957 to be replaced by 3 RAR . 3 RAR underwent six weeks of jungle training and began driving <unk> insurgents back into the jungle of <unk> and <unk> . The new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes . Again contact was limited , although 3 RAR had more success than its predecessor . By late 1959 , operations against the <unk> were in their final phase , and most communists had been pushed back and across the Thailand border . 3 RAR left Malaysia October 1959 and was replaced by 1 RAR . Though patrolling the border 1 RAR did not make contact with the insurgents , and in October 1960 it was replaced by 2 RAR , which stayed in Malaysia until August 1963 . The Malayan Emergency officially ended on 31 July 1960 . 
 Australia also provided artillery and engineer support , along with an air @-@ field construction squadron . The Royal Australian Navy also served in Malayan waters , firing on suspected communist positions between 1956 and 1957 . The Emergency was the longest continued commitment in Australian military history ; 7 @,@ 000 Australians served and 51 died in Malaya — although only 15 were on operations — and another 27 were wounded . 
 
 = = = Military and Naval growth during the 1960s = = = 
 
 At the start of the 1960s , Prime Minister Robert <unk> greatly expanded the Australian military so that it could carry out the Government 's policy of " Forward Defence " in South East Asia . In 1964 , <unk> announced a large increase in defence spending . The strength of the Australian Army would be increased by 50 % over three years from 22 @,@ 000 to 33 @,@ 000 ; providing a full three @-@ brigade division with nine battalions . The RAAF and <unk> would also both be increased by 25 % . In 1964 , conscription or National Service was re @-@ introduced under the National Service Act , for selected 20 @-@ year @-@ olds based on date of birth , for a period of two years ' continuous full @-@ time service ( the previous scheme having been suspended in 1959 ) . 
 In 1961 , three Charles F. Adams @-@ class destroyers were purchased from the United States to replace the ageing Q @-@ class destroyers . Traditionally , the <unk> had purchased designs based on those of the Royal Navy and the purchase of American destroyers was significant . <unk> Perth and <unk> Hobart joined the fleet in 1965 , followed by <unk> Brisbane in 1967 . Other projects included the construction of six River @-@ class frigates , the conversion of the aircraft carrier <unk> Melbourne to an anti @-@ submarine role , the acquisition of ten Wessex helicopters , and the purchase of six Oberon @-@ class submarines . 
 The RAAF took delivery of their first <unk> fighters in 1967 , <unk> No. 3 , No. 75 and No. 77 Squadrons with them . The service also received American F @-@ 111 strike aircraft , C @-@ 130 <unk> transports , P @-@ 3 Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft and Italian <unk> trainers . 
 
 = = = Indonesia @-@ Malaysia <unk> , 1962 – 66 = = = 
 
 The Indonesia @-@ Malaysia confrontation was fought from 1962 to 1966 between the British Commonwealth and Indonesia over the creation of the Federation of Malaysia , with the Commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state . The war remained limited , and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo , although a number of Indonesian <unk> and airborne incursions onto the Malay Peninsula did occur . As part of Australia 's continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia , army , naval and <unk> units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve . Regardless the Australian government was wary of involvement in a war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only . On two occasions Australian troops from 3 RAR were used to help <unk> up <unk> from <unk> and airborne incursions at <unk> and <unk> , in September and October 1964 . 
 Following these raids the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo . During the early phases , British and Malaysian troops had attempted only to control the Malaysian / Indonesian border , and to protect population centres . However , by the time the Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action , crossing the border into <unk> to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the <unk> to remain on the defensive , under the <unk> Operation <unk> . The fighting took place in mountainous , jungle @-@ clad terrain , and a debilitating climate , with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border , cross @-@ border operations , the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply , and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions . 
 3 RAR deployed to Borneo in March 1965 , and served in <unk> until the end of July , operating on both sides of the border . The battalion had four major contacts with Indonesian forces and several smaller ones — including at Sungei <unk> , <unk> and <unk> during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the <unk> — as well as suffering casualties in two mine incidents . 4 RAR served a less @-@ eventful tour between April and August 1966 , and also operated over the border , successfully <unk> with the <unk> on a number of occasions . A squadron of the Special Air Service Regiment ( <unk> ) was also deployed in 1965 and again in 1966 , taking part in cross @-@ border operations and inflicting significant casualties on the <unk> , even though they were often tasked with covert reconnaissance . Other units included artillery and engineers , while a number of <unk> ships were involved in shelling Indonesian positions in Borneo and in <unk> <unk> in the Singapore Strait . The RAAF played a relatively minor role , although it would have been used far more extensively had the war escalated . 
 Operations in Borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press coverage in Australia , while official acknowledgement of involvement in cross @-@ border missions only occurred in 1996 . Following a military coup in Indonesia in early 1966 which brought General <unk> to power , a peace treaty was signed in August 1966 which ended the conflict . 3 @,@ 500 Australians served during <unk> ; casualties included 16 dead , with seven killed in action and eight wounded . 
 
 = = = Vietnam War , 1962 – 73 = = = 
 
 Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War was driven largely by the rise of communism in Southeast Asia after the Second World War , and the fear of its spread which developed in Australia during the 1950s and early 1960s . As a consequence , Australia supported South Vietnam throughout the early 1960s . In 1961 and 1962 , the leader of the South Vietnamese government , <unk> <unk> <unk> , asked for assistance from the US and its allies in response to a growing insurgency supported by communist North Vietnam . Australia offered 30 military advisors from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam , which became known simply as " The Team " . They arrived in July and August 1962 , beginning Australia 's involvement in the war . Later in August 1964 , the RAAF sent a flight of <unk> transport aircraft to the port city of <unk> <unk> . 
 However , with the security situation in South Vietnam continuing to deteriorate , the US increased its involvement to 200 @,@ 000 combat troops by early 1965 . Australia also committed ground forces , dispatching the 1 RAR to serve with the US <unk> Airborne Brigade in <unk> <unk> province in June 1965 and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions , including Gang <unk> , Operation <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . In March 1966 , the Australian government announced the deployment of a brigade @-@ sized unit — the 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 <unk> ) — to replace 1 RAR . Included were a large number of conscripts , under the increasingly controversial National Service Scheme . <unk> of two infantry battalions as well as armour , aviation , artillery and other support arms , the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at <unk> <unk> , in <unk> Tuy Province . Included were the Iroquois helicopters of No. 9 Squadron RAAF . At the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 , D Company , 6 RAR with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a Viet Cong force that was at least six times bigger than itself . 18 Australians were killed and 24 wounded , while 245 communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield . The battle allowed the Australians to gain dominance over <unk> Tuy Province and 1 <unk> was not fundamentally challenged again . Regardless , during February 1967 the Australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point , losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week , the bulk during Operation <unk> . 
 Yet with the <unk> Tuy province coming progressively under control throughout 1967 , the Australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further afield . 1 <unk> was subsequently deployed <unk> infiltration routes leading to Saigon to <unk> communist movement against the capital as part of Operation <unk> during the 1968 <unk> Offensive and later during the Battle of Coral – <unk> in May and June 1968 . At Fire Support <unk> Coral and <unk> the Australians had clashed with regular North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare , ultimately fighting their largest , most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war . During 26 days of fighting Australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded , while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by body count , 60 possibly killed , 7 wounded and 11 captured . Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in June 1969 , <unk> <unk> in late @-@ December 1968 and early 1969 and Long <unk> in June 1971 . At the height of the Australian commitment , 1 <unk> numbered 8 @,@ 500 troops , including three infantry battalions , armour , artillery , engineers , logistics and aviation units in support . A third RAAF unit , No. 2 Squadron RAAF , flying Canberra bombers , was sent in 1967 , and four <unk> destroyers joined US patrols in the waters off North Vietnam . 
 The Australian withdrawal effectively commenced in November 1970 . As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war , 8 RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty . 1 <unk> was again reduced to just two infantry battalions , albeit with significant armour , artillery and aviation support remaining . Australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal , and 1 <unk> ceased operations in October . Meanwhile , the advisors remained to train South Vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 December 1972 by the newly elected Labor government of <unk> <unk> . The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973 . The Vietnam War was Australia 's longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support , as the nation 's military involvement increased a vocal anti @-@ war movement developed . More than 50 @,@ 000 Australians served in Vietnam ; <unk> were killed and 2 @,@ 398 were wounded . Four were awarded the Victoria Cross .

 Although the importance of ' joint ' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval , ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands , the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co @-@ ordination between the services in the post @-@ war era , with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine . The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military 's experiences in the Vietnam War . In 1973 , the Secretary of the Department of Defence , Arthur <unk> , submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff . 
 The <unk> Labor Government subsequently amalgamated the five defence <unk> ( Defence , Navy , Army , Air Force , and Supply ) into a single Department of Defence in 1973 , while conscription under the National Service scheme was abolished . On 1 January 1976 , the three branches of the Australian military were brought together as a unified , all @-@ volunteer , professional force known as the Australian Defence Force ( <unk> ) . Today , the <unk> is headquartered at Russell <unk> in Canberra and is divided into Air , Land , Maritime and Special Operations <unk> . In addition , Northern Command is based in Darwin , and is responsible for operations in Northern Australia . 
 
 = = = Defence of Australia , 1980s and 1990s = = = 
 
 Until the 1970s , Australia 's military strategy centred on the concept of Forward Defence , in which the role of Australian military and naval forces were to co @-@ operate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia 's region . Following the adoption of the Guam Doctrine by the United States in 1969 , and the British withdrawal ' east of Suez ' in the early 1970s , Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self @-@ reliance and the defence of the Australian continent . Known as the Defence of Australia Policy , it focused Australian defence planning on protecting the nation 's northern maritime approaches ( the ' air @-@ sea gap ' ) against possible attack . 
 In line with this goal , the <unk> was <unk> to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia . This was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the <unk> and RAAF , and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia . During this time the <unk> had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia . However , in 1987 the <unk> made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance , in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the 1987 <unk> coups d 'état . While broadly successful , this deployment highlighted the need for the <unk> to improve its capability to rapidly respond to <unk> events . 
 During this period Australia continued to retain forces in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence <unk> ( <unk> ) agreed in 1971 to defend it in the event of external attack , with this commitment initially including significant air , ground and naval forces . However , these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in 1973 , and the two <unk> fighter squadrons in 1988 . Since then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol aircraft , support personnel , and an infantry company known as Rifle Company <unk> have been maintained , as well as occasional deployments of F / A @-@ 18 <unk> fighter aircraft . Australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War . <unk> and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region . Since then the <unk> have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of Operation Gateway , conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean , Strait of <unk> and South China Sea .

 Australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War , deploying a naval task group of two warships , a support ship and a clearance diving team ; in total about 750 personnel . The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the <unk> and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure . However , the Australian force did not see combat , and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait . Some <unk> personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat , and a few were later decorated for their actions . Following the war , the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq . A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no @-@ fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003 .

 Since the late 1980s , the Australian government had increasingly called upon the <unk> to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world . While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists , several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel . Large peacekeeping deployments were made to <unk> in early 1989 , Cambodia between 1992 and 1993 , Somalia in 1993 , <unk> between 1994 and 1995 and <unk> in 1994 and from 1997 onwards . The 1996 election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the <unk> 's force structure and role , with the new government 's defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co @-@ operation with regional states and Australia 's allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia 's global security interests . In line with this new focus , the <unk> 's force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the <unk> 's combat effectiveness .

 The former @-@ Portuguese colony of East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 , however , following years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President <unk> <unk> subsequently agreed to allow the East <unk> to vote on autonomy in 1999 . The United Nations Mission in East Timor ( <unk> ) was established to organise and conduct the vote , which was held at the end of August 1999 and resulted with 78 @.@ 5 % of voters deciding in favour of independence . However , following the announcement of the results pro @-@ Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military , launched a campaign of violence , looting and <unk> and many East <unk> were killed , while perhaps more than 500 @,@ 000 were displaced . Unable to control the violence , Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force . Australia , which had contributed police to <unk> , organised and led an international military coalition , known as the International Force for East Timor ( <unk> ) , a non @-@ UN force operating in accordance with UN resolutions . The total size of the Australian force committed numbered 5 @,@ 500 personnel , and included a significant ground force , supported by air and naval forces , in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since 1945 . 
 Under the overall command of Australian Major General Peter <unk> , <unk> began arriving on 12 September 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security , protecting and supporting <unk> , and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations . With the withdrawal of the Indonesian armed forces , police and government officials from East Timor , <unk> re @-@ established its headquarters in Dili on 28 September . On 19 October 1999 , Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a UN peacekeeping force , the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor ( <unk> ) was established , becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence . The hand @-@ over of command of military operations from <unk> to <unk> was completed on 28 February 2000 . Australia continued to support the UN peacekeeping operation with between 1 @,@ 500 and 2 @,@ 000 personnel , as well as landing craft and <unk> helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission . During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro @-@ Indonesian militia and on a number of occasions Indonesian forces as well , especially along the border with West Timor . Significant actions occurred in <unk> , <unk> <unk> and at <unk> in October 1999 . However , with the security situation <unk> the bulk of the Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005 . Two Australians died from non @-@ battle related causes , while a number were wounded in action . 
 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the <unk> 's ability to conduct operations outside Australia . This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the <unk> 's ability to mount and sustain such operations . In response , the 2000 Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the <unk> for overseas deployments . The Australian government committed to improve the <unk> 's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of <unk> units , expanding the <unk> to 57 @,@ 000 full @-@ time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3 % per year . 
 In May 2006 , 2 @,@ 000 <unk> personnel were again deployed to East Timor as part of Operation <unk> , following unrest between elements of the Timor <unk> Defence Force . Australian forces were involved in a number <unk> during this time , including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by <unk> <unk> at Same on 4 March 2007 . However , by early @-@ 2010 the security situation had been <unk> and just 400 Australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force . Following a <unk> , the International <unk> Force commenced withdrawing from Timor @-@ <unk> in November 2012 , a process which was completed in April 2013 .

 Shortly after the Islamist inspired terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001 , Australian forces were committed to the American @-@ led international coalition against terrorism . The <unk> 's most visible contribution — codenamed Operation <unk> — has been a special forces task group operating in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2002 and again from mid @-@ 2005 to fight against the <unk> . Over time the Australian commitment has grown , with the addition of further ground forces in the form of a Reconstruction Task Force from 2006 to provide security , reconstruction and to mentor and train the <unk> National Army . Australia has also contributed a frigate and two AP @-@ <unk> Orion surveillance aircraft and three C @-@ 130 <unk> transport aircraft to international operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean since 2001 , supporting both the operations in Afghanistan and those in Iraq under Operation <unk> . A detachment of four F / A @-@ 18 <unk> fighter @-@ bombers was based at Diego Garcia from late @-@ 2001 to mid @-@ 2002 , while two Boeing <unk> air @-@ to @-@ air <unk> aircraft were also based in Manas Air Base in <unk> to provide support to coalition aircraft operating in <unk> airspace but were later withdrawn . A Special Operations Task Group was deployed to support the Reconstruction <unk> in April 2007 . In addition to radar crews , logistics and intelligence officers , and security personnel , this brought the number of Australian personnel in Afghanistan to 950 by mid @-@ 2007 , with further small increases to 1 @,@ 000 in mid @-@ 2008 , 1 @,@ 100 in early 2009 and 1 @,@ 550 in mid @-@ 2009 . 
 A modest force remained in Afghanistan over this time and was involved in counter @-@ insurgency operations in <unk> Province in conjunction United States and other coalition forces , including the Dutch prior to their withdrawal . The force consisted of motorised infantry , special forces , engineers , cavalry , artillery and aviation elements . By 2010 it included a combined arms battalion @-@ sized battle group known as the <unk> Task Force , and the Special Operations Task Group , both based at Forward Operation Base Ripley outside of <unk> <unk> , as well as the <unk> Wing Group flying CH @-@ <unk> <unk> , the Force <unk> <unk> and an RAAF air surveillance radar unit based in <unk> . In addition , a further 800 Australian logistic personnel were also based in the Middle East in support , but are located outside of Afghanistan . Meanwhile , <unk> of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , based out of Al <unk> Air Base in the United Arab Emirates . Also included is the deployment of one of the <unk> 's frigates to the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties . 
 Australian forces were at times involved in heavy fighting , and significant actions included Operation <unk> in 2002 and Operation Perth in 2006 , as well as actions in <unk> in 2007 , <unk> in 2009 , the Shah <unk> <unk> and <unk> in 2010 , and <unk> in 2011 ; although others have yet to be publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements . Casualties include 41 killed and 256 wounded , while another Australian also died serving with the British Army . Four Australians have been awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia , the first such decorations in forty years . Following a <unk> in forces , the last combat troops were withdrawn on 15 December 2013 ; however , approximately 400 personnel remain in Afghanistan as trainers and advisers , and are stationed in <unk> and <unk> . Over 26 @,@ 000 Australian personnel have served in Afghanistan .

 Australian forces later joined British and American forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq . The initial contribution was also a modest one , consisting of just 2 @,@ <unk> personnel — codenamed Operation <unk> . Major force elements included special forces , <unk> and fixed wing aviation and naval units . Army units included elements from the <unk> and 4th Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( Commando ) , a CH @-@ 47 <unk> detachment and a number of other specialist units . <unk> units included the amphibious ship <unk> <unk> and the frigates <unk> Darwin and <unk> Anzac , while the RAAF deployed 14 F / A @-@ 18 Hornets from No. 75 Squadron , a number of AP @-@ <unk> <unk> and C @-@ 130 <unk> . The Australian Special Forces Task Force was one of the first coalition units forces to cross the border into Iraq , while for a few days , the closest ground troops to Baghdad were from the <unk> . During the invasion the RAAF also flew its first combat missions since the Vietnam War , with No. 75 Squadron flying a total of 350 sorties and dropping 122 laser @-@ guided bombs . 
 The Iraqi military quickly proved no match for coalition military power , and with their defeat the bulk of Australian forces were withdrawn . While Australia did not initially take part in the post @-@ war occupation of Iraq , an Australian Army light armoured <unk> — designated the Al <unk> Task Group and including 40 <unk> light armoured vehicles and infantry — was later deployed to Southern Iraq in April 2005 as part of Operation <unk> . The role of this force was to protect the Japanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of New Iraqi Army units . The <unk> later became the <unk> Battle Group ( West ) ( <unk> ( W ) ) , following the hand back of Al <unk> province to Iraqi control . Force levels peaked at 1 @,@ 400 personnel in May 2007 including the <unk> ( W ) in Southern Iraq , the Security Detachment in Baghdad and the Australian Army Training Team — Iraq . A <unk> frigate was based in the North Persian Gulf , while RAAF assets included C @-@ <unk> <unk> and AP @-@ <unk> elements . Following the election of a new Labor government under Prime Minister Kevin <unk> the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid @-@ 2009 , while RAAF and <unk> operations were <unk> to other parts of the Middle East Area of Operations as part of Operation <unk> . 
 Low @-@ level operations continued , however , with a small Australian force of 80 soldiers remaining in Iraq to protect the Australian Embassy in Baghdad as part of <unk> under Operation <unk> . <unk> was finally withdrawn in August 2011 , and was replaced by a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for Australia 's diplomatic presence in Iraq . Although more than 17 @,@ 000 personnel served during operations in Iraq , Australian casualties were relatively light , with two soldiers accidentally killed , while a third Australian died serving with the British Royal Air Force . A further 27 personnel were wounded . Two officers remained in Iraq attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq as part of Operation <unk> . This operation concluded in November 2013 .

 Australia 's involvement in international peacekeeping operations has been diverse , and included participation in both United Nations sponsored missions , as well as those as part of ad @-@ hoc coalitions .

" Although Australia has had peacekeepers in the field continuously for 60 years — being among the first group of UN military observers in Indonesia in 1947 — its commitments have generally been limited , consisting mostly of small numbers of high @-@ level and technical support troops such as <unk> , engineers , <unk> , observers , and police . One significant commitment has been Australia 's ongoing involvement with the long running <unk> Force and Observers in the Sinai . The operational tempo started increasing in the mid @-@ 1990s , when Australia became involved in a series of high @-@ profile operations , deploying significantly larger combat units in support of a number of missions including Cambodia , <unk> , Somalia , East Timor , and the Solomon Islands .

 = Ward Churchill = 
 
 Ward <unk> Churchill ( born 1947 ) is an American author and political activist . He was a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1990 until 2007 . The primary focus of his work is on the historical treatment of political dissenters and Native Americans by the United States government . His work features controversial and provocative views , written in a direct , often <unk> style . 
 In January 2005 , Churchill 's work attracted controversy because of the circulation of a 2001 essay , " On the Justice of <unk> <unk> " , in which he argued the September 11 attacks were a natural and <unk> consequence of unlawful US foreign policy over the latter half of the 20th century ; the essay is well known for Churchill 's use of the phrase " little <unk> " to describe the " <unk> corps " working in the World Trade Center . 
 In March 2005 the University of Colorado began investigating allegations that Churchill had engaged in research <unk> ; it reported in June 2006 that he had done so . Churchill was fired on July 24 , 2007 , leading to a claim by some scholars that he was fired because of the " Little <unk> " comment . Churchill filed a lawsuit against the University of Colorado for unlawful termination of employment . In April 2009 a Denver jury found that Churchill was wrongly fired , <unk> him $ 1 in damages . In July 2009 , a District Court judge vacated the monetary award and declined Churchill 's request to order his <unk> , deciding the university has " quasi @-@ judicial immunity " . In February 2010 , Churchill appealed the judge 's decision . In November 2010 , the Colorado Court of Appeals upheld the lower @-@ court 's ruling . In September 10 , 2012 , the Colorado Supreme Court upheld the lower courts ' decisions in favor of the University of Colorado . On April 1 , 2013 , the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case . 
 In a February 2014 interview , Churchill commented that after living more than forty years in the northern plains / Colorado region , he had relocated to Atlanta , Georgia in 2013 . Churchill also stated that he had a half @-@ dozen uncompleted books which he intended to finish and publish in the next three years . 
 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 
 Churchill was born in <unk> , Illinois , to Jack <unk> Churchill and <unk> <unk> Allen . His parents divorced before he was two , and he grew up in <unk> , where he attended local schools . 
 In 1966 , he was drafted into the United States Army . On his 1980 resume , he said he served as a public @-@ information specialist who " wrote and edited the battalion <unk> and wrote news releases . " 
 In a 1987 profile on Churchill , the Denver Post reported that he was drafted , went to paratrooper school , then volunteered for Vietnam , where he served a 10 @-@ month tour as Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol ( <unk> ) , one of a six @-@ man team sent out to track down the enemy . The Post article also reported that Churchill was politically <unk> as a result of his experiences in Vietnam . Churchill told the Post that he had spent some time at the Chicago office of the Students for a Democratic Society ( <unk> ) in the late 1960s , and briefly taught members of the Weather Underground how to build bombs and fire weapons . 
 In 2005 , the Denver Post reported that Churchill 's military records show he was trained as a film <unk> and light truck driver , but they do not reflect paratrooper school or <unk> training . The 75th Ranger Regiment Association found no record of Churchill having been a member of the unit , or a <unk> team . 
 Churchill received his <unk> in technological communications in 1974 and <unk> in communications theory in 1975 , both from <unk> State University , now the University of Illinois at Springfield . 
 
 = = Career = = 
 
 In 1978 , Churchill began working at the University of Colorado Boulder as an <unk> action officer in the university administration . He also <unk> on American Indian issues in the ethnic studies program . In 1990 , the University of Colorado hired him as an associate professor , although he did not possess the academic doctorate usually required for the position . The following year he was granted tenure in the Communications department , without the usual six @-@ year <unk> period , after having been declined by the Sociology and Political Science departments . 
 He has long been interested in issues associated with the <unk> Act , which broke up the communal reservation lands and assigned plots to individual households . <unk> with that was the federal government 's first use of " blood quantum " to define individual membership in tribes , for what became known as the <unk> Rolls . Since re @-@ establishing self @-@ governments , <unk> recognized tribes have established their own criteria for enrollment as members , often related to descent from recognized historical lists , but less often requiring proofs of blood quantum . Some of his published works address these issues , which he has interpreted as part of the federal government 's policy of <unk> against Native Americans . 
 In 1995 Churchill discussed his views with David <unk> in an interview : 
 You could say that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in <unk> @-@ America . But in Anglo @-@ America , while there was some preoccupation with it , it was not formalized until the passage of the General <unk> Act , mid @-@ 1880s . At that point they began to define Indian as being someone who was <unk> and <unk> of at least one @-@ quarter by quantum blood indigenous in a given group . You couldn 't be an eighth Cheyenne and an eighth <unk> and be an Indian . You had to be a quarter Cheyenne or a quarter <unk> or hopefully a quarter and a quarter . The reason for this was quite clear . They were identifying Indians for purposes of <unk> them individual <unk> of land in the existing reservation base at that point . If they ran out of Indians identifiable as such , then the rest of the land would be declared surplus . So it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a definition of <unk> that would minimize the number of Indians that were available . It was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to <unk> in the first place . It 's become increasingly so ever since . " ( David <unk> ( December 1995 ) . " Interview with Ward Churchill : Historical and Current <unk> " . Z Magazine . ) 
 In 1996 , Churchill moved to the new <unk> Studies Department of the University of Colorado . In 1997 , he was promoted to full professor . He was selected as chairman of the department in June 2002 . 
 In January 2005 , during the controversy over his 9 / 11 remarks , Churchill resigned as chairman of the ethnic studies department at the University of Colorado — his term as chair was scheduled to <unk> in June of that year . On May 16 , 2006 , the <unk> Committee of the Standing Committee on Research <unk> at the University of Colorado concluded that Churchill had committed multiple counts of academic <unk> , specifically plagiarism , fabrication , and <unk> . On July 24 , 2007 , Churchill was fired for academic <unk> in an eight to one vote by the University of Colorado 's Board of <unk> .

 In 2003 , Churchill stated , " I am myself of <unk> and Creek descent on my father 's side , <unk> on my mother 's , and am an enrolled member of the United <unk> Band of <unk> Indians . " In 1992 , Churchill wrote elsewhere that he is one @-@ eighth Creek and one @-@ sixteenth <unk> . In 1993 , Churchill told the Colorado Daily that " he was one @-@ sixteenth Creek and <unk> . " Churchill told the Denver Post in February 2005 that he is three @-@ <unk> <unk> . 
 In a statement dated May 9 , 2005 , and posted on its website , the United <unk> Band initially said , 
 " The United <unk> Band would like to make it clear that Mr. Churchill <unk> <unk> a member of the <unk> Band and was only given an honorary ' associate membership ' in the early 1990s because he could not prove any <unk> ancestry . " The tribe said that all of Churchill 's " past , present and future claims or <unk> of <unk> ' enrollment , ' written or spoken , including but not limited to ; biographies , curriculum <unk> , lectures , applications for employment , or any other reference not listed <unk> , are deemed <unk> by the United <unk> Band . " 
 Two days later , the United <unk> Band replaced its statement and acknowledged Churchill 's " alleged ancestry " of being <unk> : 
 " Because Mr. Churchill had genealogical information regarding his alleged ancestry , and his willingness to assist the <unk> in promoting the tribe and its causes , he was awarded an ' Associate <unk> ' as an honor , " the tribe 's website now said . " However , Mr. Churchill may possess eligibility status for <unk> Nation of Oklahoma , since he claims 1 / 16 <unk> . " 
 The tribe 's spokesperson , Lisa <unk> , stated the tribe <unk> only members with certified one @-@ quarter American Indian blood . The website statement further clarified that Churchill " was not eligible for tribal membership due to the fact that he does not possess a ' Certificate of <unk> of Indian Blood ( <unk> ) " , and the associate membership did not <unk> an individual to voting rights or enrollment in the tribe . 
 Churchill has never asked for <unk> certification , and finds the idea of being " <unk> " by the US government offensive . 
 In June 1994 , the United <unk> Band had voted to stop <unk> associate <unk> . Such honorary associate membership recognizes an individual 's assistance to the tribe , but it has nothing to do with Indian ancestry , and it does not <unk> an individual to vote in the tribe as a member . The <unk> Band states that Churchill still holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded . In a separate interview , <unk> Berry , formerly on the tribe 's enrollment committee and four years on its council , said that Churchill had never fulfilled a promise to help the tribe . 
 In June 2005 , the Rocky Mountain News published an article about Churchill 's genealogy and family history . It " turned up no evidence of a single Indian ancestor " among 142 direct ancestors [ of Churchill 's ] identified from records . The News reported that both Churchill 's birth parents were listed as white on the 1930 census , as were all but two of his great @-@ great @-@ grandparents listed on previous census and other official documents . The News found that some of Churchill 's accounts of where his ancestors had lived did not agree with documented records . Numerous members of Churchill 's extended family have longstanding family legends of Indian ancestry among ancestors ; but , none was confirmed among the 142 direct forebears of Churchill who were identified . 
 <unk> in Churchill 's university personnel file show that he was granted tenure in a " special opportunity position . " In 1994 , then <unk> @-@ Boulder Chancellor James <unk> refused to take action on allegations that Churchill was <unk> claiming to be an Indian , saying " it has always been university policy that a person 's race or ethnicity is self @-@ proving . " 
 Some of Churchill 's Native American critics , such as Vernon <unk> ( White Earth Ojibwe ) and <unk> <unk> <unk> ( Southern Cheyenne @-@ <unk> Creek ) , argue that his assertion of Native American ancestry without the ability to prove it might constitute <unk> and grounds for termination . The University has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity . The University of Colorado 's Research <unk> Committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether Churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to " add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship . " The committee concluded that the allegation was not " appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research <unk> . " 
 In a 2005 interview in The Rocky Mountain News , Churchill said , " I have never been confirmed as having one @-@ quarter blood , and never said I was . And even if [ the critics ] are absolutely right , what does that have to do with this issue ? I have never claimed to be <unk> <unk> Bull . " The longtime indigenous activist Russell <unk> said in February of that year , " So I want , from this day forward , every media person nationally , internationally and locally to know that we have <unk> that Ward Churchill is a full @-@ <unk> Indian leader . " 
 
 = = = Blood quantum = = = 
 
 Churchill has responded to requests for <unk> of his claimed Indian heritage in various ways , including attacking the blood quantum upon which some Native American tribes establish their membership requirements . Churchill argues that the United States instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of <unk> in order to further goals of personal <unk> and political <unk> . 
 For decades in his writings , Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent <unk> purpose . He says , 
 " Set the blood quantum at one @-@ quarter , hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians , let <unk> proceed as it [ has ] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence " . 
 Churchill 's <unk> have been raised as one of the several research @-@ <unk> allegations that were brought against him in 2005 ( see below ) . He has been accused of using his interpretation of the <unk> Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member . 
 
 = = Writing = = 
 
 Churchill has written on American Indian history and culture , and speaks about <unk> inflicted on the indigenous people of the Americas by European settlers and what he describes as the repression of native peoples that continues to this day . 
 As of 2007 , according to a report submitted on his behalf , Churchill has written 10 books on his own and co @-@ authored 4 . Some have been reprinted with updates . He has written 51 book chapters , 3 law reviews , and 50 scholarly essays ; 27 of these were <unk> . He has edited 4 volumes and co @-@ edited 3 more . 
 According to the University of Colorado investigation , " His academic publications are nearly all works of synthesis and <unk> , drawing upon studies by other scholars , not <unk> describing new research based on primary sources . " The investigation also noted that " he has decided to publish largely in alternative presses or journals , not in the university presses or mainstream peer @-@ reviewed journals often favored by more conventional academics . " In addition to his academic writing , Churchill has written for several general readership magazines of political opinion . 
 In 1986 , Churchill wrote an essay titled <unk> as <unk> : Notes on an American <unk> criticizing pacifist politics within the U.S. left as being <unk> , de facto racist and <unk> . In 1998 , <unk> Ring Publishing published the essay in a book entitled <unk> as <unk> : Reflections on the Role of Armed <unk> in North America and listing Ward Churchill as the author . The book included a preface by Ed Mead , a new introduction to the essay by Churchill and a commentary by Mike Ryan . The book sparked much debate in leftist circles and inspired more aggressive tactics within the anti @-@ <unk> movement in the following few years . 
 Agents of <unk> ( 1988 ) , co @-@ authored by Jim <unk> Wall , describes what the authors claim was a secret war against the Black Panther Party and American Indian Movement carried out during the late 1960s and ' 70s by the FBI under the <unk> program . The <unk> <unk> ( 1990 ; reissued 2002 ) , also co @-@ authored with Jim <unk> Wall , examines a series of original FBI <unk> that detail the Bureau 's activities against various leftist groups , from the U.S. Communist Party in the 1950s to activists concerned with Central American issues in the 1980s . 
 In Fantasies of the Master Race ( 1992 ) , Churchill examines the portrayal of American Indians and the use of American Indian symbols in popular American culture . He focuses on such phenomena as Tony <unk> 's mystery novels , the film <unk> with Wolves , and the New Age movement , finding examples of cultural imperialism and exploitation . Churchill calls author Carlos <unk> 's claims of revealing the teachings of a <unk> Indian <unk> , the " greatest hoax since <unk> Man . " 
 <unk> for the Land ( 1993 ; reissued 2002 ) is a collection of essays in which Churchill chronicles what he describes as the U.S. government 's systematic exploitation of Native lands and the killing or displacement of American Indians . He details Native American efforts in the 19th and 20th centuries to prevent <unk> and industrial practices such as surface mining . 
 Churchill 's Indians Are Us ? ( 1994 ) , a sequel to Fantasies of the Master Race , further explores American Indian issues in popular culture and politics . He examines the movie Black Robe , the Pine Ridge Indian <unk> killings , the prosecution of Leonard <unk> , sports <unk> , the Indian Arts and <unk> Act of 1990 , and blood quantum laws , calling them tools of <unk> . Churchill is particularly outspoken about New Age <unk> of <unk> and American Indian sacred traditions , and the " do @-@ it @-@ yourself <unk> " of certain contemporary authors . John P. <unk> of the University of New Mexico School of Law published a review of Indians Are Us ? in The American Indian Quarterly . Professor <unk> , an enrolled member of the <unk> Sioux Nation , states that Indians Are Us ? twists historical facts and is hostile toward Indian tribes . It was in this book that Churchill first made the claim that the United States distributed " smallpox @-@ infested blankets " to Indian tribes , a claim which he repeated several times over the next decade . The claim has been criticized as a <unk> . Churchill has , however , received support from some scholars . 
 From a Native Son : Selected Essays on <unk> , 1985 – 1995 ( 1996 ) is a collection of 23 previously published essays on Native American history , culture , and political activism . In his introduction to this volume , Howard <unk> <unk> " the emergence of a new generation of Native @-@ American scholars " and describes Churchill 's writing as " powerful , <unk> , <unk> of <unk> and deception " . 
 Churchill 's A Little <unk> of <unk> ( 1997 ) is a survey of ethnic cleansing in the Americas from <unk> to the present . He compares the treatment of North American Indians to historical instances of <unk> by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia , Turks against <unk> , and Europeans against the <unk> , as well as Nazis against the Poles and Jews . 
 In <unk> of Justice ( 2002 ) , Churchill argues that the U.S. ' s legal system was adapted to gain control over Native American people . <unk> the evolution of federal Indian law , Churchill argues that the principles set forth were not only applied to non @-@ Indians in the U.S. , but later adapted for application abroad . He concludes that this demonstrates the development of the U.S. ' s " imperial logic , " which depends on a " corrupt form of <unk> " to establish colonial control and empire . 
 Churchill 's controversial essay on 9 / 11 was expanded into a book @-@ length manuscript , published as On the Justice of <unk> <unk> : Reflections on the <unk> of U.S. Imperial <unk> and <unk> ( 2003 ) by AK Press . The book features two other chapters , one listing US military <unk> , another listing what Churchill believes to be US violations of international law . The original essay takes the " roosting chickens " of the title from a 1963 Malcolm X speech , in which Malcolm X linked the assassination of U.S. president John F. Kennedy to the violence which Kennedy <unk> as " merely a case of chickens coming home to roost . " Churchill 's essays in this book address the worldwide forms of resistance that he posits were and continue to be provoked by U.S. imperialism of the 20th and 21st centuries . 
 In Kill the Indian , Save the Man : The <unk> Impact of American Indian Residential Schools ( 2004 ) , Churchill traces the history of removing American Indian children from their homes to residential schools ( in Canada ) or Indian boarding schools ( in the USA ) as part of government policies ( 1880s – 1980s ) which he regards as <unk> .

 Churchill has been active since at least 1984 as the co @-@ director of the Denver @-@ based American Indian Movement of Colorado , now an autonomous chapter of the American Indian Movement . In 1993 , he and other local <unk> leaders , including Russell <unk> , Glenn T. Morris , Robert <unk> , and David Hill , broke with the national <unk> leadership , including Dennis Banks and the brothers Vernon and Clyde <unk> , claiming that all <unk> chapters are autonomous . The <unk> Grand <unk> Council is based in Minneapolis and retains the name of the national group . It says that the schism arose when <unk> , Churchill , Glenn T. Morris and others openly supported the <unk> Indian group <unk> , who were allied with the anti @-@ revolutionary , CIA @-@ backed <unk> . 
 Journalists such as <unk> <unk> attributed the split to <unk> and other <unk> members dividing over opposition to the <unk> brothers because of their alleged involvement in the execution of Anna <unk> <unk> in December 1975 , who was then the highest @-@ ranking woman in <unk> but had been suspected of being an informant . It was a year in which other FBI <unk> had been discovered in <unk> . On November 3 , 1999 , <unk> held a press conference in Denver , Colorado in which he accused the <unk> brothers of <unk> in <unk> 's death , and named three lower @-@ level <unk> members involved in her death : <unk> Looking Cloud , John Graham , and <unk> Nelson Clark . This was the first time that an <unk> leader active at the time of the <unk> murder had publicly accused <unk> of having been involved . 
 Looking Cloud and Graham were convicted of murder in 2004 and 2010 , by federal and South Dakota state <unk> , respectively . By then Clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted . <unk> attributed the split in <unk> to divisions in the aftermath of <unk> 's murder . The journalist <unk> <unk> said in 1999 , " ... her [ <unk> 's ] death has divided the American Indian Movement ... " 
 The schism continued , with the national <unk> leadership claiming that the local <unk> leaders , such as Churchill , are tools of the U.S. government used against other American Indians . The leaders of the national <unk> organization , now called <unk> Grand <unk> Council , claim that Churchill has worked in the past as an underground counter @-@ intelligence source for the U.S. government , for example the FBI , and local , non @-@ Indian , police forces , to <unk> the national <unk> organization . Specifically , they refer to a 1993 Boulder , Colorado interview with <unk> <unk> , a former columnist for the Denver Post , in which Churchill stated that he " was teaching the Rapid City Police Department about the American Indian Movement . " In addition , Vernon <unk> accused Churchill of having ' <unk> represented himself as an Indian ' to bolster his credentials . <unk> said he complained to the University of Colorado about this as early as 1986 . 
 Churchill has been a leader of Colorado <unk> 's annual protests in Denver against the Columbus Day holiday and its associated parade . Colorado <unk> 's leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the Denver Italian American community , the main supporters of the parade . As early as 2004 , Churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional , arguing that the <unk> Amendment to the Constitution provides Native Americans with a right not to be subjected to such displays , <unk> the First Amendment rights of non @-@ Native Americans .

 Churchill wrote an essay in September 2001 entitled On the Justice of <unk> <unk> . In it , he argued that the September 11 attacks were provoked by U.S. foreign policy . He compared the role of financial workers at the World Trade Center in " ongoing <unk> American imperialism " to the role played by Adolf <unk> in organizing the Holocaust . In 2005 , this essay was widely publicized when Hamilton College invited Churchill to speak . This led to both condemnations of Churchill and counter @-@ accusations of <unk> by Churchill and supporters . Following the controversy , the University of Colorado interim Chancellor Phil <unk> said , " While Professor Churchill has the constitutional right to express his political views , his essay on 9 / 11 has outraged and <unk> us and the general public . " 
 A documentary called <unk> Fire : Stories from the Edge of Free Speech , broadcast on HBO , prominently features Churchill 's case in addressing the issues of free speech and First Amendment rights .

 The controversy attracted increased academic attention to Churchill 's research , which had already been criticized by the legal scholar John <unk> and historian <unk> <unk> . Additional critics were the sociologist Thomas Brown , who had been preparing an article on Churchill 's work , and the historians <unk> Robertson and Russell <unk> , who claimed that Churchill had misrepresented their work . In 2005 , University of Colorado Boulder administrators ordered an investigation into seven allegations of research <unk> , including three allegations of plagiarism , and four allegations of fabrication or <unk> regarding the history of the <unk> Act , the Indian Arts and <unk> Act of 1990 , and statements that smallpox was intentionally spread to Native Americans by John Smith in <unk> and by the United States Army at Fort Clark in 1837 ( not to be confused with the well @-@ documented use of smallpox @-@ infected blankets at Fort Pitt in 1764 ) . 
 On May 16 , 2006 the University released their findings ; the <unk> Committee agreed unanimously that Churchill had engaged in " serious research <unk> " , including <unk> , fabrication , and two of the three allegations of plagiarism . The committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions . The Standing Committee on Research <unk> accepted the findings of the <unk> Committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed . Churchill 's appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the University 's <unk> and <unk> Committee , which found that two of the seven findings of <unk> did not constitute <unk> offences . Three members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and one year 's suspension without pay , while two favored dismissal . 
 On July 24 , 2007 , the University <unk> voted seven to two to uphold all seven of the findings of research <unk> , <unk> the recommendation of <unk> and <unk> panel that two be dismissed . By a vote of eight to one , the <unk> determined to fire Churchill . 
 The next day , Churchill filed a lawsuit in state court claiming that the firing was <unk> for his expressing politically unpopular views . The jury in Churchill 's suit for <unk> weighed the university 's claims of academic <unk> per jury instructions it received in the case . As Stanley Fish said , " It was the jury ’ s task to determine whether Churchill ’ s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his <unk> protected statements . " The jury found that the alleged <unk> would not have led to Churchill 's firing and rejected the university 's academic <unk> claim as the grounds for dismissal . On April 1 , 2009 , a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired , and awarded $ 1 in damages . As one of the jurors said later in a press interview , " it wasn 't a <unk> in his face or anything like that when we didn 't give him any money . It 's just that [ Churchill 's attorney ] David Lane kept saying this wasn 't about the money , and in the end , we took his word for that . " Churchill 's counsel asked Chief Judge Larry J. <unk> of the Denver District Court to order <unk> in light of the verdict . 
 On July 7 , 2009 , Judge <unk> found that the defendants ( university ) were entitled to quasi @-@ judicial immunity as a matter of law , vacated the jury verdict and determined that the University did not owe Churchill any financial compensation . <unk> denied Churchill 's request for <unk> at <unk> . 
 Churchill appealed both decisions . On November 24 , 2010 , a three @-@ judge panel of the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court 's decision . In February 2011 , Churchill filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Colorado Supreme Court . In late May 2011 , the Colorado Supreme Court agreed to hear his case . Court records indicate that oral arguments began June 7 , 2012 . On September 10 , 2012 , the court ruled that the University had " quasi @-@ judicial immunity " , upholding the trial court 's ruling . On April 1 , 2013 , the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Churchill .

 Churchill 's subjects are often American Indian figures and other themes associated with Native American Culture . He uses historical photographs as source material for works . In the early 1990s at Santa Fe Indian Market , Churchill protested the passage of the 1990 Indian Arts and <unk> Act . It requires that , to identify and exhibit works as being by a Native American , artists and craftsmen must be enrolled in a Native American tribe or designated by a tribe as an <unk> . Under federal law , Churchill cannot identify his art as by a Native American . 
 Some of Churchill 's pieces may <unk> <unk> . For example , his 1981 <unk> Winter Attack was , according to Churchill and others , based on a 1972 drawing by the artist Thomas E. <unk> Churchill printed 150 copies of Winter Attack and sold at least one of them . Other copies are available online for purchase . Churchill says that , when he produced Winter Attack , he publicly acknowledged that it was based on <unk> ' work .

 Fort Scott National Historic Site is a historical area under the control of the United States National Park Service in Bourbon County , Kansas , United States . Named after General Winfield Scott , who achieved <unk> during the Mexican @-@ American War , during the middle of the 19th century the fort served as a military base for US Army action in what was the edge of settlement in 1850 . For the next quarter century , it was used as a supply base and to provide security in turbulent areas during the opening of the West to settlement , a period which included Bleeding Kansas and the American Civil War . 
 The current national historic site protects 20 historic structures , a parade ground , and five acres ( 20 @,@ 000 m ² ) of restored <unk> prairie , inside the city of Fort Scott . It is open to visitors most days of the year .

 In 1842 , Fort Scott was named after Winfield Scott , was established on the American frontier on the military road in eastern Kansas between Fort <unk> and Fort Gibson . It was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number of settlers , who were migrating from the Eastern United States . Fort Scott became one of a chain of forts intended to protect the new settlers from the Plains Indians , as well as to protect the Indians from the settlers ' encroachment . 
 The United States government intention to reserve permanent Indian lands west of the Missouri River gave way to the competition of settlers continuing to <unk> on the Indian settlements . Fort Scott 's most active days were between 1842 and 1853 , although it was also used during the Civil War . 
 
 = = = Army days = = = 
 
 The <unk> of Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma ) were upset to have Fort Wayne in their proximity . After some delay , the US Army decided to abandon Fort Wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between Fort <unk> and the site . The Army both wanted to <unk> the <unk> ( who were supervised by the Department of Defense ) and provide more defense for white settlers and other Indians against the Osage , who had been conducting frequent raids in the area . On April 1 , 1842 , some soldiers of Fort Wayne left their fort and on April 22 arrived where Fort Scott would be built , in the Osage <unk> section of modern @-@ day Kansas . After <unk> with the <unk> to acquire the land , the rest of Fort Wayne 's garrison left the fort on May 26 and arrived at the Fort Scott site on May 30 . 
 Unlike most forts for military use , the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built ; the wide @-@ open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary . The soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men , animals , and equipment . These buildings were on the edges of a 350 @-@ foot ( 110 m ) parade ground . 
 The post <unk> , Captain Thomas Swords , was in charge of building Fort Scott 's structures , and had to deal with the problems of construction on the Kansas prairie , which had few trees . He had only two <unk> and three carpenters to rely on , as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform . Wood was available , but the mill was built 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) away , making transport time consuming . Swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood , skilled labor and working equipment . Freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort 's construction . As a result , only one <unk> of the five planned officers quarters ( four <unk> and post commandant 's house ) was built by 1844 , and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed . In his 1844 inspection of the fort , Colonel George <unk> reported that , in comparison to other frontier forts , he considered Fort Scott " above average " . 
 Due to the rising tensions that escalated in the Mexican @-@ American War , the US Army redeployed troops to the Southwest . With Fort Scott still uncompleted , officials decided on April 25 , 1850 , that no more construction would be done there , after eight years and $ 35 @,@ 000 . By the time it was finished , it was obsolete ; three years later , it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western Fort Riley . 
 For the average soldier , life at the fort was " <unk> " . Until the permanent structures were built , soldiers had to live in tents , which lacked comfort . Aside from a few whiskey <unk> and prostitutes , few civilians lived at the fort . Officers had brought their personal slaves with them , including Captain Swords . Five miles East in Missouri was a <unk> shop that supplied soldiers , and quite a few courts @-@ martial followed soldiers ' going <unk> at the shop . The <unk> rate from the fort ranged from 12 % <unk> % , due to boredom , irregular pay , and hatred for military life . As no combat took place near the fort , it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base . Hunting was a popular <unk> ; according to Captain Swords , " wolf chasing and duck hunting " was the only way one officer could tolerate the place .

 Two years after the army abandoned the fort , the buildings were sold by auction to civilians , with two being converted to hotels . In 1854 the Kansas @-@ Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri <unk> of 1820 , which had kept slavery out of Kansas . <unk> in favor of slavery soon moved to Kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not Kansas would permit slavery . Settlers from New England arrived equally determined to keep it out . Each of the two competing factions of the Bleeding Kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at Fort Scott : Free @-@ Soil at the Fort Scott Hotel and Pro @-@ <unk> at the Western Hotel . Most of the residents in Fort Scott supported slavery , but those outside the town tended to the free @-@ soil side . During this time , there were local incidents of murder and attempted <unk> , typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting .

 During the American Civil War , the fort was renewed as a US military post . In August 1861 , the Union Army took command of Fort Scott , and <unk> it for the war times . The United States Army also took over several blocks within the town for <unk> and <unk> functions . The Union Army rented the properties from the current civilian owners . Troops from Indiana , Iowa , Colorado , Ohio , and Wisconsin would come to the fort , and either stayed by the fort , or traveled farther , to <unk> Missouri , Arkansas , or the Indian Territory . Fort Scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the United States <unk> Troops of the Union Army . 
 A major supply depot was situated at the fort . Confederate general Sterling Price hoped to capture the town , but the closest the Confederate force came to the garrison was 10 miles ( 16 km ) away at Battle of Dry Wood Creek . The site was strategically important as it was within a Southern @-@ <unk> area and close to the Confederate state of Arkansas and the " unstable " Indian Territory ( present @-@ day state of Oklahoma ) , where many of the members of the Five <unk> <unk> were allied with the Confederates . The fort served as a " general hospital " ( large military hospital ) and prison until after the war . Following the end of the war , in October 1865 the US Army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled . 
 On January 14 , 1870 , the Army returned with the formation of the Post of Southeast Kansas . The Post was based at Fort Scott , but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks , and seldom used the original fort . They were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers . Some of the latter feared that the railroad , which had been awarded land for development by the US Government in rights @-@ of @-@ way , would evict them from their <unk> homes . The settlers considered the troops <unk> to the railroads , and <unk> both as enemies . 
 Settlers also had some continuing conflicts with Indians and insurgents using the recent Confederate cause as excuse for robbery . By the spring of 1873 , the US Army withdrew the troops from Fort Scott for good . From 1873 to 1965 , the buildings of the fort were left <unk> , and slowly deteriorated . Many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use .

 With the Act of August 31 , 1965 , the National Park Service gave the city government of Fort Scott , Kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort . 
 On October 19 , 1978 , Fort Scott became a National Historic Site under the supervision of the National Park Service , encompassing 17 acres ( 69 @,@ 000 m2 ) . Today the fort is open throughout the year , save for <unk> , Christmas , and New Years Day . <unk> has declined in recent years . In 2005 visitation was 25 @,@ <unk> ; in 2007 it was 22 @,@ 314 . 
 Surviving structures include four officers ' barracks , one <unk> 's barracks , two infantry barracks , a hospital , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , ordnance and post headquarters , <unk> <unk> , <unk> shop , flagpole , and magazine .

They were hardly an overly wealthy family , and their table was never notable for an <unk> of the good things of life , but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time . " 
 " On the night before such an event neither <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> Gale could get those minutes ' solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests ' comfort . At the first <unk> of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the <unk> into shape . So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid <unk> <unk> <unk> - the <unk> were ever looking after the need of the said <unk> . First <unk> Gale would <unk> to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state , and give it a stir ; then <unk> Gale would <unk> over and give it a stir ; finally <unk> Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise . Then arrived the guests . The Minister and the Mrs. Minister , they were , and some neighbors . While she was receiving them the recollection came to <unk> Gale that the beloved <unk> <unk> had not received its <unk> . Off she speeds to a <unk> of whiskey in the kitchen . She <unk> into the <unk> the right proportion of liquor , and goes back to her guests . Then <unk> Gale remembers that the <unk> has not been flavored . He , too , <unk> himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred <unk> . No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than <unk> Gale , who has just remembered about the forgotten <unk> , rushes in and makes for the whiskey . She <unk> ' the right proportion ' in , too . "

 The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced <unk> employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was <unk> in 1910 productions . The cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary . In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films . The list includes <unk> <unk> , <unk> D. Barnes , Frank H.

 The single reel comedy , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released on September 27 , 1910 . The film likely had a wide national release , with advertisements in theaters known in Indiana , Kansas , Wisconsin , and Pennsylvania . The film would also be shown in Vancouver , Canada and was met with praise by the audience at the Province Theatre . In 1917 , years after the film 's release , the film was approved without censorship by the Pennsylvania State Board of <unk> of Moving Pictures . 
 The The Moving Picture World reviewer found the subject to be too long , but did not find it to be a fault . The reviewer states , " A domestic comedy with a different flavor . In fact , with a <unk> <unk> for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook , the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of <unk> , neither one knowing that the others have done likewise . The humor in this piece centers around this <unk> . What happened to the guests who <unk> of it certainly draws upon the imagination . Imagine eight people , not to speak of the cat , getting drunk on the brandy in one <unk> <unk> ! ... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week . <unk> as well as <unk> were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters . The <unk> <unk> episode was well done , which is the faint praise that we do not like to <unk> out to anyone . " Walton of The Moving Picture News was not <unk> by the plot and stated , " To me the last scene had no humor . It was only the necessary ending to the beginning . True humor does not <unk> from <unk> . " The New York Dramatic Mirror stated , " This is the old story of too many cooks , and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way . The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation . ... A weak point in the story is the fact that the <unk> is cut into eight small pieces , making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power . Two <unk> would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing . The character parts are all well taken , although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera . "

 " Back Off <unk> " is a song by English musician <unk> Starr , released as a non @-@ album single in March 1972 . Starr 's former Beatles <unk> George Harrison produced the recording , which took place in London shortly after the two had appeared together at Harrison 's Concert for Bangladesh shows in August 1971 . The single was a follow @-@ up to Starr 's 1971 hit song " It Don 't Come Easy " and continued his successful run as a solo artist . " Back Off <unk> " peaked at number 2 in Britain and Canada , and number 9 on America 's Billboard Hot 100 . It remains Starr 's highest @-@ charting single in the United Kingdom . 
 The title for the song was inspired by English singer @-@ songwriter Marc <unk> . Some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at Paul McCartney , reflecting Starr 's disdain for the music McCartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years . " Back Off <unk> " demonstrates the influence of <unk> rock on Starr , who directed a documentary film , Born to Boogie ( 1972 ) , about <unk> 's band T. Rex around this time . Described by one author as a " high @-@ energy in @-@ your @-@ face rocker " , the song features a prominent slide guitar part by Harrison and contributions from musicians Gary Wright and Klaus <unk> . 
 Starr re @-@ recorded " Back Off <unk> " for his 1981 album Stop and <unk> the Roses , in a collaboration with American singer Harry Nilsson that incorporates lyrics from Beatles songs such as " With a Little Help from My Friends " , " Good Day Sunshine " and " Baby , You 're a Rich Man " . The original version has appeared on Starr 's compilation albums <unk> from Your Past and <unk> : The Very Best of <unk> Starr , and as a bonus track on his remastered 1974 studio album <unk> Vienna . Since his return to touring in 1989 , Starr has performed " Back Off <unk> " regularly in concert with the various <unk> of his All @-@ Starr Band . 
 
 = = Background and composition = = 
 
 <unk> Starr identified his initial inspiration for " Back Off <unk> " as having come from Marc <unk> , the singer and guitarist with English <unk> rock band T. Rex . In a 2001 interview with <unk> editor Paul Du <unk> , Starr described <unk> as " a dear friend who used to come into the office when I was running Apple Movies , a big office in town , and the hang @-@ out for myself , Harry Nilsson and Keith Moon " . Over dinner one evening at Starr 's home outside London , <unk> had used the word " <unk> " so often that it stuck in Starr 's mind , after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight . When discussing the composition on VH1 <unk> in May 1998 , Starr explained : " [ <unk> ] was an <unk> guy . He used to speak : ' Back off <unk> ... <unk> you , <unk> . ' ' Do you want some potatoes ? ' ' <unk> you , <unk> ! ' " Starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children 's toys that night , in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song . 
 The lyrics to the middle eight of " Back Off <unk> " came to Starr while watching London Weekend Television 's football show , The Big Match . The program 's host , Jimmy Hill , often referred to a footballer 's playing as " <unk> " , a catchphrase that Starr incorporated into his song lyrics : 
 Get yourself together now 
 And give me something <unk> 
 Everything you try to do 
 You know it sure sounds wasted . 
 Commentators have interpreted the song , and particularly this statement , as an attack by Starr on his former Beatles <unk> Paul McCartney . Starr has denied any such interpretation , instead " claiming that the song was inspired by <unk> and nothing more " , Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez writes . Starr had publicly criticised McCartney 's solo albums McCartney ( 1970 ) and Ram ( 1971 ) on release , and author Bruce <unk> <unk> the message of the middle eight as " a plea for Paul to produce better music " . The mention of " sound [ ing ] wasted " could also be a reference to McCartney 's <unk> with cannabis , Rodriguez suggests . A further example of Starr 's allegedly anti @-@ McCartney message exists in the song 's first verse : 
 Wake up , <unk> 
 Don 't pretend that you are dead 
 Get yourself up off the cart . 
 The same commentators suggest that here Starr could be referring to the 1969 " Paul Is Dead " hoax . The latter <unk> circulated during September and October of that year while McCartney hid away on his Scottish farm , <unk> after John Lennon had told him and Starr that he wanted a " divorce " from the Beatles . 
 In addition to these supposed messages in " Back Off <unk> " , observers have viewed the song title as Starr 's <unk> to McCartney to abandon his legal stand against the Beatles and Apple Corps , which was placed in receivership in March 1971 after a High Court judge found in McCartney 's favour . Author Keith <unk> writes that " <unk> " had " long been cited as Paul 's nickname " from his former bandmates Starr , Lennon and George Harrison . While acknowledging that in subsequent years Starr might have chosen to minimise any ill @-@ feeling towards McCartney , Rodriguez notes that the lyrics " just happened to fit perfectly into the ' us vs. Paul ' mindset " following the Beatles ' break @-@ up , to the extent that " Back Off <unk> " was " as <unk> as ' Early 1970 ' had been <unk> " . When <unk> his 1970 composition " I 'm the Greatest " for Starr to record on the album <unk> ( 1973 ) , Lennon referenced the song title with the lines " Now I 'm only thirty @-@ two / And all I want to do is <unk> " . 
 Although " T Rex devotees " , in the words of Starr biographer Alan <unk> , claimed that <unk> had ghost @-@ written " Back Off <unk> " , Starr later acknowledged that Harrison co @-@ wrote the song by adding some chords and finishing the melody . As on Starr 's 1971 hit single " It Don 't Come Easy " , Harrison was not credited for his songwriting contribution . Starr originally offered " Back Off <unk> " to fellow <unk> <unk> Black to record , but she declined , hoping instead to record another new Starr – Harrison composition , " <unk> " .

 Having earmarked the song as his next single , Starr recorded " Back Off <unk> " in September 1971 , following his appearance at the Harrison @-@ organised Concert for Bangladesh in New York . The sessions took place at Apple Studio in central London , with Harrison producing , as he had on " It Don 't Come Easy " . The recording reflects the influence of <unk> rock on Starr through what authors <unk> <unk> and Mark Easter term " its big drum sound and <unk> nature " , with a line @-@ up comprising Starr ( vocals , drums , percussion ) , Harrison ( guitars ) , Gary Wright ( piano ) and Klaus <unk> ( bass , saxophone ) . 
 Rodriguez describes Starr 's " martial @-@ sounding opening " as a rare " showcase for his own drumming " , while Harrison biographer Simon <unk> writes of " a <unk> series of Harrison slide breaks that brought to mind <unk> <unk> " . Further overdubs included contributions from three backing vocalists , led by American soul singer Madeline Bell .

 Apple Records issued the single on 17 March 1972 in Britain , as Apple R <unk> , with a US release taking place three days later , as Apple 1849 . It was Starr 's first release since " It Don 't Come Easy " , a year before . During this period , his priority had been to develop a career as an actor in films such as 200 <unk> ( 1971 ) and <unk> . Further <unk> himself with Britain 's <unk> rock movement , Starr made his directorial debut with Born to Boogie ( 1972 ) , a film starring <unk> that included Starr 's footage of a T.

With " Back Off <unk> " , NME critic Bob <unk> noted Starr 's success in establishing himself in the two years since the Beatles ' break @-@ up , and wrote that the single " confirmed that he and Harrison , dark horses both , were the ones who had managed their solo careers more purposefully and <unk> " compared with McCartney and Lennon . 
 The song was a hit in the US , reaching number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 , and achieved Starr 's best position on the UK Singles Chart , where it reached number 2 . A promotional video for " Back Off <unk> " was shot on 20 March at Lennon 's Tittenhurst Park residence while Starr was looking after the property . The video , which shows Starr walking around an outdoor structure and followed by a <unk> @-@ like monster , was directed by Tom Taylor and financed by <unk> Films . A similar monster appeared on the single 's picture sleeve , holding a cigarette . 
 Alan <unk> writes of reviewers criticising " Back Off <unk> " for being <unk> , leading Starr to respond in a 1973 interview : " Play me a pop song that isn 't . " On release , Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker : " A Number One hit could easily be in store for the <unk> of rock drums . There 's a touch of the Marc <unk> in this highly playable rhythmic <unk> ... It 's hypnotic and effective , ideal for <unk> and liable to send us all mad by the end of the week . " <unk> described the single as " every bit as <unk> " as " It Don 't Come Easy " , although " slightly inferior " , while Mike <unk> of AllMusic views it as a song where " [ t ] he <unk> spirit of <unk> Starr shines through " . In a 1974 article for the NME , Charles <unk> Murray highlighted " Back Off <unk> " as a " great radio and <unk> @-@ box tune " .

In the 2005 publication NME <unk> : Beatles – The Solo Years 1970 – 1980 , Paul Moody listed " Back Off <unk> " first among Starr 's " ten solo gems " and described it as " Good time rock <unk> to match the Faces " . Guitar World editor Damian <unk> includes the song on his list of Harrison 's ten best post @-@ Beatles " Guitar <unk> " , saying of the recording : " the main event is clearly Harrison 's slightly wild , <unk> – and very <unk> – slide guitar solo , which includes an alternate melody line that 's even <unk> than the melody <unk> is singing .

 " Where the Streets Have No Name " is a song by Irish rock band U2 . It is the opening track from their 1987 album The Joshua Tree and was released as the album 's third single in August 1987 . The song 's hook is a repeating guitar <unk> using a delay effect , played during the song 's introduction and again at the end . Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person 's religion and income based on the street on which they lived , particularly in Belfast . During the band 's difficulties recording the song , producer Brian Eno considered <unk> the song 's tapes to have them start from scratch . 
 " Where the Streets Have No Name " was praised by critics and became a commercial success , peaking at number thirteen in the US , number fourteen in Canada , number ten in the Netherlands , and number four in the United Kingdom . The song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in 1987 on The Joshua Tree Tour . The song was performed on a Los Angeles <unk> for the filming of its music video , which won a Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video . 
 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 
 The music for " Where the Streets Have No Name " originated from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed the night before the group resumed The Joshua Tree sessions . In an upstairs room at <unk> House — his newly purchased home — The Edge used a four @-@ track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards , bass , guitar , and a drum machine . <unk> that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs , The Edge wanted to " <unk> up the ultimate U2 live @-@ song " , so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future U2 show if he were a fan . After finishing the rough mix , he felt he had come up with " the most amazing guitar part and song of [ his ] life " . With no one in the house to share the demo with , The Edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration . 
 Although the band liked the demo , it was difficult for them to record the song . <unk> Adam Clayton said , " At the time it sounded like a foreign language , whereas now we understand how it works " . The arrangement , with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes , was <unk> many times , but the group struggled to get a performance they liked . According to co @-@ producer Daniel Lanois , " that was the science project song . I remember having this massive schoolhouse <unk> , as we call them . I was holding a pointer , like a college professor , walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking <unk> . It was ridiculous . " Co @-@ producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of " Where the Streets Have No Name " . The band worked on a single take for weeks , but as Eno explained , that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up . Through all of their work , they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance . 
 So much time had been spent on " <unk> work " that Eno thought it would be best to start from scratch . His idea was to " stage an accident " and have the song 's tapes erased . He said that this was not to force abandonment of the song , but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance . At one point , Eno had the tapes <unk> up and ready to be recorded over , but this <unk> never took place ; according to engineer Flood , fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes , dropped the <unk> of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno . 
 The studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes . It was one of several songs mixed by Steve <unk> in the final months of recording The Joshua Tree . Drummer Larry Mullen , Jr. later said of the song , " It took so long to get that song right , it was difficult for us to make any sense of it . It only became a truly great song through playing live . On the record , musically , it 's not half the song it is live . " 
 
 = = Composition = = 
 
 " Where the Streets Have No Name " is played at a tempo of 126 beats per minute . The introduction and <unk> are played in a 3 / 4 time signature , while the remainder of the song is in a common 4 / 4 signature . The songs opens with an instrumental section , starting with <unk> @-@ like sustained <unk> notes . The guitar fades in after 42 seconds ; this part consists of a repeated " <unk> " six @-@ note <unk> . A " dotted eighth " delay effect is used to " play " each note in the <unk> twice , thus creating a rich sound . The bass and drums enter at 1 : 10 . 
 The introduction , following a I – IV – I – IV – vi – V – I chord progression , creates a " wall of sound " , as described by Mark Butler , against which the vocals emerge after nearly two minutes . The guitar part played for the remainder of the song features The Edge strumming <unk> sixteenth notes . The bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes , respectively , while Bono 's vocal performance , in contrast , varies greatly in its <unk> , ( " he <unk> ; he <unk> ; he <unk> ; he <unk> <unk> ; he allows his voice to crack " ) as well as timing by his usage of <unk> to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat . 
 This development reaches a climax during the first chorus at the line " burning down love " ( A – G – F ♯ – D ) ; the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song , the <unk> at " burning " . In later choruses , Bono sings " blown by the wind " with the same melody , stretching the same note even longer . After the third chorus , the song 's <unk> is played , the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction , with a six @-@ note guitar <unk> played against sustained <unk> notes . 
 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 
 The lyrics were inspired by a story that Bono heard about the streets of Belfast , Northern Ireland , where a person 's religion and income are evident by the street they live on . He contrasted this with the <unk> he felt when visiting Ethiopia , saying : " ... the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren 't such divisions , a place where the streets have no name . To me , that 's the way a great rock ' n ' roll concert should be : a place where everyone comes together ... Maybe that 's the dream of all art : to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all . " Bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to Ethiopia with his wife , Ali Hewson ; he first wrote them down on an <unk> bag while staying in a village . 
 According to him , the song is ostensibly about " <unk> , elevation , whatever you want to call it . " Bono , who compared many of his lyrics prior to The Joshua Tree to " sketches " , said that " ' Where the Streets Have No Name ' is more like the U2 of old than any of the other songs on the LP , because it 's a sketch — I was just trying to sketch a location , maybe a spiritual location , maybe a romantic location . I was trying to sketch a feeling . " 
 The open @-@ ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations . Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send " a message of hope " and wish for a " world that is not divided by class , wealth , race , or any other arbitrary criterion " . With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song , he said , " I 'm not sure , really , about that . I used to think it was Belfast ... " Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono 's and his wife Ali 's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid @-@ workers . Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open @-@ ended lyrics : " I can look at it now and recognize that [ the song ] has one of the most <unk> couplets in the history of pop music . But it also contains some of the biggest ideas . In a curious way , that seems to work . If you get any way heavy about these things , you don 't communicate . But if you 're flip or <unk> about it , then you do . That 's one of the <unk> I 've come to terms with . "

 The video begins with an aerial shot of a block in Los Angeles , and clips of radio broadcasts are heard with disc <unk> stating that U2 is planning on performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds of 30 @,@ 000 people . Police show up to the set and inform the band 's crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing , due to the large number of people who are coming to watch the performance . Two minutes into the video , U2 are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of 7th <unk> and S. Main St. , and perform " Where the Streets Have No Name " to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building . Towards the end of the song , the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down , and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are <unk> the police . 
 The video for " Where the Streets Have No Name " was directed by <unk> Avis and produced by Michael <unk> and Ben <unk> . The band attracted over 1 @,@ 000 people during the video 's filming , which took place on the <unk> of a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles on 27 March 1987 . The band 's performance on a <unk> in a public place was a reference to The Beatles ' final concert , as depicted in the film Let It Be . 
 During the shoot U2 played an eight @-@ song set , which included four performances of " Where the Streets Have No Name " . Prior to filming , a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be <unk> by a group of fans . A backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator , which happened during filming . 
 The depiction of the police attempting to shut down the video shoot due to safety concerns actually happened during filming , just as seen in the video . <unk> was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police . According to Avis , the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day " almost in real time " , and that " getting <unk> was an integral part of the plan . " Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated ; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to <unk> the music video , but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video . In the background of the video is a sign for The Million Dollar Hotel , which was rebuilt to create some interest , in case no one showed up at the film shoot . Although the video is of a live performance , the audio used is from the studio @-@ recorded version of the song . The video won the Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video at the 1989 Grammy Awards .

 " Race Against Time " was released on the 12 @-@ inch , cassette , and CD versions of the single . The song developed from the band 's interest in urban funk , and was described by The Edge as " a kind of Afro @-@ rhythmic piece " and " a study in rhythm . " The bass riff in the song , inspired by the <unk> , was played by The Edge , but stemmed from some of Clayton 's unused bass parts . Mullen 's drum part was recorded in a single take . The song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by Bono 's trip to Ethiopia after Live Aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence ; these lyrical references include Bono singing in an Ethiopian language and following it with the phrase " Race against time " . Bono said of the song , " It reminds me of the desert . The desert is so empty , but it <unk> with a strange kind of <unk> . " John Hutchinson of Musician magazine described the song as having an " African flavour " and as being reminiscent of Peter Gabriel . The track was used in the Miami Vice episode " Child 's Play " , and is the only one of the single 's B @-@ sides that was never played live . 
 " Silver and Gold " was written in support of the Artists United Against <unk> project , which protested the South African apartheid . In 1985 , Bono participated in Steven Van <unk> 's anti @-@ apartheid Sun City project and spent time with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones . When Richards and Jagger played blues , Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre , as most of U2 's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid @-@ 1970s . Bono realised that U2 " had no tradition " , and he felt as if they " were from outer space " . This inspired him to write the blues @-@ influenced song " Silver and Gold " , which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood . It was re @-@ recorded by U2 for the " Where the Streets Have No Name " single while the band returned to Dublin during in May 1987 during a break between the first and second legs of The Joshua Tree Tour . The song was described by Musician as " tough and raw , with Bono in <unk> and confident voice , <unk> by a <unk> bass line , and with The Edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues @-@ based guitar . " " Silver and Gold " was played live on The Joshua Tree Tour several times , one performance of which was featured on the band 's 1988 album and <unk> , Rattle and Hum . Both the studio recording and the Sun City versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the 20th anniversary edition of The Joshua Tree . The studio version was also included on the limited edition B @-@ sides bonus disk of the band 's first compilation album , The Best of 1980 – 1990 . 
 " <unk> Thing " was written by Bono as an apology to his wife for forgetting her birthday . The song opens with a short piano piece before the rest of the band begins to play . Some of Bono 's lyrics have been described as reminiscent of John Lennon . The Edge described it as " a beautiful song ... which is pop as it should be — not produced out of existence , but pop produced with a real intimacy and purity " , also noting that " It 's very new for us . " It was re @-@ recorded with some lyrical alterations and released in 1998 as a single in its own right for The Best of 1980 – 1990 . Hot Press editor Niall Stokes stated that this track , along with " Race Against Time " , is " an indicator of what U2 might have made instead of The Joshua Tree . "

 Upon the release of The Joshua Tree , critics praised " Where the Streets Have No Name " . Steve <unk> of The Boston Globe noted the " bell @-@ like tones from the Edge <unk> [ e ] a search for heaven " and along with the subsequent track on the album , " I Still Haven 't Found What I 'm Looking For " , these songs showed how the group were " pilgrims still on a quest ; not preachers who claim to have found answers " . The Bergen Record echoed these sentiments , saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest . Rolling Stone called it " assertive rock " in their review of The Joshua Tree . The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune said of " Where the Streets Have No Name " , " the music charges , like someone fleeing for life " . The Washington Post said the track is " a bit oblique lyrically , but the implications are clear in Bono 's resolute delivery , Dave ( the Edge ) Evan 's <unk> guitar , Adam Clayton 's cathedral bass and Larry Mullen 's rolling thunder drums " . 
 NME lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album " starts by spitting furiously " . The publication praised Bono 's impassioned singing and The Edge 's guitar playing , which transformed the instrument into " something more than an <unk> abused piece of wood " . The review commented that the " last ten seconds are <unk> beautiful " . The Rocket wrote that the song builds a " wall of sound " that Bono 's vocals cut through with a " <unk> of <unk> , as the lyrics <unk> the need for personal spirituality " . The reviewer compared the opening riff to <unk> <unk> ' " <unk> " . Reviewing The Joshua Tree , Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song an " epic opener " . The service 's Steve Huey , in a review of the song , praised its " <unk> , propulsive rhythmic drive and <unk> chorus " , qualities he singled out for making it a fan favorite . He called the song the " perfect album @-@ opener " , <unk> the " slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic peak " . Huey also called Bono 's delivery " passionate and grandiose " and " his commitment to the material <unk> " . He believed the combination of his vocals and the band 's " sonic power " is what gave U2 its " tremendous force " .

 " Where the Streets Have No Name " made its concert debut on 2 April 1987 in <unk> , Arizona on the opening night of The Joshua Tree Tour . It has since been played at nearly every full @-@ length concert that U2 has <unk> , totaling over 700 performances as of 2011 . The song is widely regarded as one of the group 's most popular live songs . Bono said of it , " We can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives , but when we go into that song , everything changes . The audience is on its feet , singing along with every word . It 's like God suddenly walks through the room . " 
 On The Joshua Tree Tour , " Where the Streets Have No Name " was most often used to open concerts . Fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting . The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune wrote that , " From the <unk> sonic opening strains of [ the song ] , this audience was up , <unk> and <unk> . " NME wrote that the song is one such occasion where " the power afforded their songs is scary " , noting that during the song 's opening , " the arena <unk> " . In other reviews , the song was called : " <unk> " , " <unk> " , and " powerful " . Out of the 109 shows during The Joshua Tree Tour , " Streets " was played at all except 12 of the concerts . During the <unk> Tour which took place in 1989 and the beginning of 1990 , " Streets " was only left out of the set list at one of the 47 concerts . 
 The song was performed at every show on the 1992 – 1993 Zoo TV Tour . Concerts from this tour were elaborate <unk> <unk> that Bono performed as a variety of characters , but for the end of the main set , the group reverted to playing classics , including " Where the Streets Have No Name " , straight . Some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from The Joshua Tree 's photo shoot . The video was <unk> up for humorous effect — NME described the effect as giving it a " silly , Charlie <unk> quality " — and Bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens . This video would make a return during performances on the 2010 and 2011 legs of the U2 360 ° Tour . Some of the Zoo TV performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the Pet Shop Boys ' synthpop cover of the song ( titled " Where the Streets Have No Name ( I Can 't Take My Eyes off You ) " ) . Bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the Pet Shop Boys ' cover . Critics welcomed the song in the group 's setlist : The Independent said the song " <unk> instant euphoria , as U2 do what they 're best at , slipping into epic rock mode , playing music made for the arena " . In two other local newspaper reviews , critics praised the song 's inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits . 
 For the PopMart Tour of 1997 – 1998 , U2 returned to the electronic dance arrangement they occasionally played on the Zoo TV Tour . The set 's massive video screen displayed a video that Hot Press described as an " astonishing , 2001 @-@ style trip into the heart of a <unk> , psychedelic tunnel that sucks the audience in towards a horizontal <unk> " . Near the end of the song , peace <unk> were shown on the screen and bright beams of light flanking the set 's golden arch were projected upwards . Hot Press said the effect transformed the stadium into a " UFO landing site " . 
 Shortly before the third leg of the <unk> Tour , the September 11 attacks occurred in New York City and Washington D.C. During the band 's first show in New York City following the attacks , the band performed " Where the Streets Have No Name " , and when the stage lights illuminated the audience , the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans . The experience was one inspiration for the song " City of <unk> Lights " . The band paid tribute to the 9 / 11 victims during their performance of the song at the Super Bowl <unk> halftime show on 3 February 2002 . The performance featured the names of the September 11 victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band . U2 's appearance was later ranked number 1 on Sports Illustrated 's list of " Top 10 Super Bowl <unk> <unk> " . 
 For the Vertigo Tour , the group originally considered dropping the song from their <unk> , but Mullen and Clayton successfully argued against this . All 131 of the Vertigo Tour concerts featured a performance of the song , which were accompanied by the stage 's LED video <unk> displaying African flags . On the tour 's opening night , this reminded Bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an Ethiopian village . He thought this visual accompaniment made the song come full circle , saying , " And here it was , nearly twenty years later , coming back to Africa , all the stuff about <unk> lands and <unk> making sense for the first time . " The song was also played at the preview screening of the band 's concert film U2 3D at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival . At the Glastonbury Festival 2010 , The Edge accompanied rock band <unk> for a live cover version of the track , later playing it with U2 while headlining Glastonbury in 2011 . 
 Live performances of " Where the Streets Have No Name " appear in the concert video releases Rattle and Hum , Zoo TV : Live from Sydney , and PopMart : Live from Mexico City , as well as the respective audio releases of the latter two concerts , Zoo TV Live and Hasta la Vista Baby ! U2 Live from Mexico City . A second version from the PopMart Tour was featured on Please : <unk> Live EP , and later on the U.S. " Please " single . A live recording from Boston during the <unk> Tour was featured in the concert film <unk> 2001 : Live from Boston , and on the " Walk On " and " Electrical Storm " singles . The concert video and album U2 Go Home : Live from <unk> Castle , Ireland featured another performance from the <unk> Tour , and later performances were featured in the concert films Vertigo 2005 : Live from Chicago and U2 3D ( Vertigo Tour ) , and U2 360 ° at the Rose Bowl ( U2 360 ° Tour ) . The 2004 digital album , Live from the Point Depot , contains a performance from the <unk> Tour , only available as part of The Complete U2 digital box set .

 In 2002 , Q magazine named " Where the Streets Have No Name " the <unk> " most exciting tune ever " . The following year , Q ranked the song at number <unk> in a special edition titled " <unk> Best Songs Ever " . Three years later , the magazine 's readers voted the track the 43rd @-@ greatest song in history . Rolling Stone ranked the song at number 28 on its list of the " 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time . " In a 2010 poll by fan site <unk> U2 , approximately 29 % of 4 @,@ 800 <unk> named " Where the Streets Have No Name " as their favourite song from The Joshua Tree , ranking it as the most popular song from the album . In 2010 , American sports network ESPN used the track , among other U2 songs , in commercials for the 2010 FIFA World Cup , with the South African <unk> Gospel Choir adding vocals to the song . The advertisement , titled " <unk> Island " , portrays South African political prisoners during the apartheid era forming a soccer team . There are plans to bring a recording of the <unk> @-@ supported performance to retail . Composer John <unk> used the introductory guitar theme in his 2009 piece for wind ensemble , Aurora <unk> .

 = <unk> <unk> reaction = 
 
 The <unk> <unk> reaction ( often referred to as simply the <unk> <unk> ) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of <unk> . The reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants , depending on the reagents and substrates employed . It was originally discovered by Ivan <unk> <unk> ( 1906 – 1957 ) in 1941 while studying the <unk> of <unk> vinyl <unk> . 
 As originally described , the <unk> <unk> involves the activation of a <unk> <unk> using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or <unk> acid promoter . The key step of the reaction mechanism involves a <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> ring closure which forms the <unk> product ( See <unk> below ) . As the reaction has been developed , variants involving substrates other than <unk> <unk> and <unk> other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name <unk> <unk> provided that they follow a similar <unk> pathway . 
 The success of the <unk> <unk> as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and <unk> of <unk> as both motifs in natural products ( including <unk> , the <unk> , and a <unk> of <unk> ) and as useful synthetic <unk> for total synthesis . The reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published . 
 
 = = <unk> = = 
 
 The mechanism of the classical <unk> <unk> reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by <unk> to be an <unk> <unk> and is outlined below . <unk> of the <unk> by the acid catalyst generates a <unk> cation which undergoes a <unk> allowed <unk> <unk> <unk> as dictated by the Woodward @-@ Hoffman rules . This generates an <unk> cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β @-@ hydrogen . Subsequent <unk> of the <unk> produces the <unk> product . 
 As noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what <unk> a <unk> <unk> in particular is the generation of the <unk> cation followed by <unk> ring closure to an <unk> cation . In order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s @-@ trans / s @-@ trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation . The <unk> of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with α @-@ substituted substrates having an increased population of the <unk> <unk> due to <unk> strain . <unk> of an electron <unk> α @-@ <unk> by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation . 
 Similarly , β @-@ substitution directed inward <unk> the s @-@ trans conformation so severely that E @-@ Z <unk> has been shown to occur in advance of <unk> on a wide range of substrates , yielding the trans <unk> regardless of initial configuration . In this way , the <unk> <unk> is a rare example of a <unk> <unk> reaction , whereas most <unk> are <unk> . The example below uses <unk> hydride to trap the <unk> cation so that no elimination occurs . ( See <unk> <unk> below ) 
 Along this same vein , <unk> vinyl <unk> of the type studied extensively by Marcus <unk> of the University of Hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of β @-@ <unk> , <unk> a large amount of <unk> strain in the s @-@ <unk> <unk> . 
 
 = = Classical <unk> <unk> = = 
 
 Though <unk> following the general template above had been observed prior to <unk> 's involvement , it was his study of the <unk> of <unk> vinyl <unk> that marked the first major examination of this process . <unk> correctly reasoned that the <unk> <unk> <unk> in situ to form a <unk> <unk> before ring closure to the <unk> product . The reaction shown below involves an <unk> <unk> reaction to generate the <unk> <unk> . 
 Research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years , until in the mid @-@ 1980s when several syntheses employing the <unk> <unk> were published . <unk> below are key steps in the syntheses of <unk> and Nor @-@ <unk> , the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> that generates the <unk> <unk> . 
 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 
 The classical version of the <unk> <unk> suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to <unk> . The first two are not evident from the mechanism alone , but are indicative of the barriers to <unk> ; the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and <unk> of the intermediate . 
 Strong Lewis or <unk> acids are typically required for the reaction ( e.g. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) . These <unk> are not compatible with sensitive functional groups , limiting the substrate scope . 
 Despite the <unk> possibility for catalysis , multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction . This limits the atom economy of the reaction . 
 The elimination step is not <unk> ; if multiple β @-@ <unk> are available for elimination , various products are often observed as mixtures . This is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as <unk> separation is typically required . 
 <unk> destroys a potential <unk> , decreasing the potential usefulness of the reaction . 
 <unk> of the <unk> is sometimes not <unk> , meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of <unk> . 
 
 = = Modern variants = = 
 
 The shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the <unk> <unk> reaction in its canonical form . However , modifications to the reaction focused on <unk> its issues continue to be an active area of academic research . In particular , the research has focused on a few key areas : rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter , <unk> the reaction with more mild <unk> to improve functional group tolerance , directing the <unk> of the elimination step , and improving the overall <unk> . These have been successful to varying degrees . 
 Additionally , modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction , either by generating the <unk> cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the <unk> cation " intercepted " in various ways . Furthermore , enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed . The sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field ; key examples are given below . 
 
 = = = <unk> @-@ directed <unk> = = = 
 
 The earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the <unk> <unk> took advantage of the β @-@ silicon effect in order to direct the <unk> of the elimination step . This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott Denmark of the University of Illinois , <unk> @-@ <unk> in the mid @-@ 1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron <unk> to promote the reaction . With <unk> products , the <unk> <unk> was selected for to varying degrees . 
 The silicon @-@ directed <unk> <unk> reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product <unk> , shown below . The <unk> takes place before elimination of the <unk> alcohol <unk> , so that the resulting <unk> of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the <unk> <unk> anti to the <unk> . 
 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 
 Drawing on the <unk> effects compiled over various trials of the reaction , Professor Alison Frontier of the University of Rochester developed a paradigm for " polarized " <unk> <unk> in which electron <unk> and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction . Creation of an effective vinyl <unk> and vinyl <unk> in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper <unk> and <unk> elimination . In addition , the electron withdrawing group increases the <unk> of the α @-@ proton , allowing selective formation of the trans @-@ α @-@ <unk> via <unk> . 
 It is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a <unk> or withdrawing group alone , although the efficiency of the reaction ( yield , reaction time , etc . ) is typically lower . 
 
 = = = Alternative cation generation = = = 
 
 By extension , any <unk> cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a <unk> <unk> . There have been a large number of examples published where the <unk> cation is arrived at by a variety of <unk> . One such example involves the silver <unk> <unk> ring opening of <unk> <unk> <unk> . The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of <unk> silver chloride . 
 In the total synthesis of <unk> , <unk> of a vinyl <unk> <unk> likewise generates a <unk> cation via ring opening of the resultant <unk> . 
 
 = = = <unk> <unk> = = = 
 
 Once the <unk> has occurred , an <unk> cation is formed . As discussed extensively above , the typical course for this intermediate is elimination followed by <unk> <unk> . However , these two steps can be interrupted by various <unk> and <unk> , respectively . <unk> cation trapping has been developed extensively by <unk> G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field . The <unk> cation can be trapped with <unk> and carbon <unk> and can also undergo <unk> <unk> with various <unk> partners . <unk> below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a <unk> core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity . 
 <unk> trapping with various <unk> is <unk> less common . In one study , the <unk> <unk> is paired with a Michael reaction using an <unk> catalyst to initiate nucleophilic <unk> addition of the <unk> to β @-@ <unk> . In this tandem reaction the <unk> catalyst is required for both <unk> : it acts as the Lewis acid in the <unk> <unk> and in the next step the <unk> group of <unk> first coordinates to <unk> in a ligand exchange with the <unk> <unk> oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R @-@ group . 
 
 = = = <unk> variants = = = 
 
 The development of an enantioselective <unk> <unk> is a desirable addition to the repertoire of <unk> <unk> reactions . To that end , several variations have been developed utilizing <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> are also known , in which extant <unk> direct the <unk> . Almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of <unk> ; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to " <unk> " in turn sets the <unk> as shown below . 
 <unk> @-@ directed <unk> <unk> can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way . In the example below , the <unk> @-@ group acts to direct the <unk> by preventing the distant <unk> from rotating " towards " it via unfavorable <unk> interaction . In this way the silicon acts as a <unk> auxiliary . ( The starting material is not <unk> but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the <unk> . ) 
 <unk> 's <unk> substrates can exhibit axial to <unk> <unk> transfer if <unk> <unk> are used . The example below generates a <unk> <unk> in 64 % yield and 95 % enantiomeric excess . 
 <unk> has additionally developed a camphor @-@ based auxiliary for <unk> <unk> that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of <unk> . The key step employs an unusual mixture of <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ <unk> and <unk> as solvent . 
 The first <unk> Lewis acid promoted asymmetric <unk> <unk> was reported by <unk> Aggarwal and utilized copper ( II ) <unk> ligand complexes with up to 98 % ee . The enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of 50 <unk> % of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased .

 <unk> of the <unk> <unk> are generally also subsumed under the same name . For example , an α @-@ β , γ @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> can undergo a similar <unk> <unk> <unk> that is typically referred to as an <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> reaction . Other such extensions have been given similar names , including <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .

 Because they <unk> the <unk> cation , β @-@ electron <unk> <unk> often severely impede <unk> <unk> . Building from this , several <unk> ring openings of β @-@ <unk> <unk> have been reported . These are typically referred to as retro @-@ <unk> <unk> reactions . 
 
 = = = <unk> @-@ <unk> reaction = = = 
 
 <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> reaction ( known as <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> reactions ) have few instances ; there is one example of a <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> reported ( shown below ) , and several <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> reactions in the literature . Even these tend to suffer from poor <unk> , poor yields , or narrow scope . The difficulty stems from the relative over @-@ stabilization of the <unk> cation by electron donation , <unk> <unk> .

The plot follows three friends , played by Bateman , Day , and Sudeikis , who decide to murder their respective overbearing , abusive bosses , portrayed by Spacey , Aniston and Farrell . 
 <unk> 's script was bought by New Line Cinema in 2005 and the film spent six years in various states of pre @-@ production , with a variety of actors attached to different roles . By 2010 , Goldstein and <unk> had rewritten the script , and the film finally went into production . 
 The film premiered in Los Angeles on June 30 , 2011 , and received a wide release on July 8 , 2011 . The film exceeded financial expectations , <unk> over $ 28 million in the first three days , making it the number two film in the United States during its opening weekend , and going on to become the highest @-@ grossing black comedy film of all time in <unk> dollars , breaking the record previously set by The War of the Roses in 1990 . The film grossed over $ <unk> million worldwide during its theatrical run . 
 The film opened to positive critical reception , with several critics praising the ensemble cast , with each lead being singled out for their performances across reviews . The plot received a more mixed response ; some reviewers felt that its dark , humorous premise was explored well , while others felt the jokes were racist , <unk> , and <unk> . A sequel , <unk> <unk> 2 , was released on November 26 , 2014 .

Nick and <unk> 's workplace is the " <unk> " bullpen , which was designed to " enhance the discomfort and anxiety of lower @-@ level employees clustered in the center of the room where every movement is monitored by the boss from his corner office . " The design team met with financial <unk> and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low @-@ ranking position in a <unk> and aspiring to an office . Costume designer Carol Ramsey worked with <unk> and set <unk> Jan <unk> to match <unk> 's suit to that of the surrounding " cold grey and blue " color palette of his office . <unk> 's home was described as " equally lacking in warmth " as the office but more lavishly decorated and " for show " , including an intentionally oversized portrait of him with his " trophy wife " . 
 <unk> Julia 's office was described as a " challenge " , <unk> a " sensual vibe " into a <unk> office . <unk> approached the design through Julia 's mentality , stating , " She 's a Type A professional at the top of her game , who likes to play cat @-@ and @-@ mouse , so it 's a completely controlled environment , with <unk> and views into other rooms so she always knows what 's going on " . " It 's highly designed , with rich <unk> and tones , <unk> artwork and subtle lighting — all very <unk> till you step into her private office . The <unk> close , the door locks and you think , ' It 's the Temple of Doom . ' " Similarly approaching the character 's home , the design allowed for wide windows which face onto a public street " which afford her the opportunity to put on the kind of show she couldn 't get away with at work . " 
 Bobby 's environments were designed with more contrast , the character being new to the work area . <unk> described the contrast as " the company reflects [ Jack <unk> 's ] human touch , whereas [ Bobby <unk> 's ] home is a <unk> shrine to himself and his <unk> <unk> . " <unk> continued , " It features a <unk> of anything he finds exotic and erotic , mostly Egyptian and Asian motifs with an ' 80s Studio 54 vibe , a makeshift <unk> , lots of mirrors and a <unk> table . " Some parts of the house design were provided by Farrell and Gordon 's interpretation of the character and his " infatuation " with martial arts and " his <unk> of prowess " .

 Filming of <unk> <unk> took place in and around Los Angeles . The production team attempted to find locations " that people haven 't already seen a hundred times in movies and on TV " , aiming for the film to appear as if it could be taking place anywhere in America " where people are trying to pursue the American dream but getting stopped by a horrible boss . " " <unk> " was represented by an office building in <unk> , California , with the crew building the set on a vacant floor . For " <unk> Chemical " , the production team found a " perfect landscape of pipes and containers " in Santa Fe Springs , surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility . To take advantage of the surrounding imagery , the warehouse required an extensive series of <unk> , including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new <unk> to allow for visuals of the warehouse exterior and provide a setting for the final scene of Sutherland 's character . A <unk> Friday 's in Woodland Hills , Los Angeles , was used as a bar frequented by Nick , Dale , and Kurt , while the bar scene where they meet with Jones was staged in downtown Los Angeles .

 <unk> recorded the soundtrack at The Village recording studio in West Los Angeles and Capitol Records . <unk> attempted to remain " authentic " to the characters ' progression from average worker to calculated killer . To achieve this aim , he decided against recording digitally , instead recording the tracks on two @-@ inch analog tape , intending each musical cue to sound as if it was emanating from a vinyl record . He explained , " The idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album . It isn 't over @-@ produced or <unk> and digital in any way . It 's <unk> , noisy , and full of <unk> and <unk> . I knew that if we could <unk> some of this sonic magic in the score , then the <unk> and confidence of the music would play against Bateman , Sudeikis , and Charlie Day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that <unk> . " <unk> continued , " We tracked through tape before Pro Tools to get that fat sound , and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection . We even used the same <unk> that Money Mark played on Beck 's classic ‘ Where It 's At ’ . At the end of the day , Seth [ Gordon ] and I wanted to produce a score that is as <unk> and full of attitude as the movie itself . I think we did it ... and most of all , everyone had a blast in the process . "

 The conspirators included : Ma Anand <unk> , <unk> @-@ Anne <unk> , Chief Financial Officer of <unk> ; Susan <unk> , head of security at <unk> , Catherine Jane <unk> , who bought weapons and <unk> and volunteered to be the actual murderer ; Ann <unk> McCarthy , fourth @-@ in @-@ command of <unk> ; and co @-@ conspirators Alma Potter , Carol Matthews , <unk> Caldwell and Richard Kevin <unk> .

 Prosecution of the conspirators began in 1990 , when a federal grand jury brought <unk> against several of the key players .

" Jesus Grove referred to a group of trailers where all the leaders of the <unk> commune resided , except for <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 Ma Anand <unk> and three other <unk> followers traveled to New York in the spring of 1985 to acquire false identification . According to a federal <unk> , the <unk> of the assassination plot used a false birth certificate to purchase guns . Two members of the group then traveled to Texas to purchase <unk> . Caldwell stated she and Catherine Jane <unk> flew to Texas to purchase guns there . They purchased five guns in Texas , but encountered difficulty purchasing <unk> in Texas with out @-@ of @-@ state identification and traveled to New Mexico instead . Caldwell said they called back to the commune but the women were instructed " not to come back without the guns " . 
 In New Mexico , they obtained false identification , and purchased several pistols . Their intention was to purchase guns which were difficult to trace . Caldwell said it was easy to obtain guns in New Mexico : " we found it was pretty easy to buy guns . All you had to do was show some identification and it was easy to get . " Caldwell said she and <unk> went to a university library to find the identity " of someone dying very young " , next went " to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate " and described how " we got a rent <unk> book and just made up a rent <unk> " . " And then we were able to go to several different gun shops in <unk> with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets , " said Caldwell . They were able to obtain one <unk> <unk> @-@ caliber revolver , and four <unk> <unk> @-@ caliber Security @-@ Six Magnum <unk> .

 After obtaining guns the conspirators returned to Portland , Oregon . They rented out an apartment in Portland to serve as their base of operations for the assassination of Turner . <unk> follower Carol Matthews ( Ma <unk> <unk> ) used a fake name during the planning of the assassination plot , in an attempt to obtain the home address of Charles Turner . According to federal prosecutors Matthews obtained a college <unk> of Turner 's , and learned his car 's license plate number and his parking location . Court records state that Matthews and an <unk> co @-@ <unk> gave <unk> registration officials fake identities and told officials they were conducting " a <unk> survey on President Reagan 's economic plan " , in order to obtain Turner 's route number and post office box number . The two tried repeating the story with members of the U.S. Postal Service , but the postal officials did not give them Turner 's address . They then drove around Turner 's neighborhood and were able to find his home by locating a sign in front of his residence that said " Turner " . Matthews had pictures of Turner 's residence developed ; these were later obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) during an investigation of the <unk> commune , and verified after being shown to Turner . 
 Members of the group of conspirators watched Turner 's office , home and car , and discussed methods to assassinate him , hoping that his death would hinder the efforts of the federal investigation into <unk> . Their plan was to shoot Turner in the garage of the federal office building where he worked , in Portland , Oregon , but the conspirators also debated whether to murder Turner in downtown Portland or closer to his home . After spending multiple nights watching Turner 's house , the conspirators decided on the parking garage because they felt it would be too risky to murder him on the drive to or from work , or in front of his home . Turner had a reserved parking spot in a federal garage underneath Terry <unk> Plaza in Portland , Oregon . In an <unk> given to the FBI , <unk> Alma <unk> described how the <unk> decided on the federal parking garage as the location : " <unk> <unk> [ Catherine Jane <unk> ] said this seems like a good place to bump this fellow off . " 
 The conspirators practiced different ways of murdering Turner . According to informant statements to law enforcement , one of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble , and the others would then approach Turner with their guns . <unk> later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international network of <unk> <unk> if the plan was successful . According to The <unk> the <unk> were not carried out because Ma Anand <unk> became distracted by political power plays within the <unk> commune and other members of the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group .

It earned $ 432 million worldwide , becoming the sixth highest grossing film of 2002 . 
 Die Another Day became a controversial subject in eastern Asia . The North Korean government disliked the portrayal of their state as brutal and war @-@ hungry . The South Koreans boycotted 145 theatres where it was released on 31 December 2002 , as they were offended by the scene in which an American officer issues orders to the South Korean army in the defence of their homeland , and by a <unk> scene near a statue of the Buddha . The <unk> Buddhist Order issued a statement that the film was " <unk> to our religion and does not reflect our values and ethics " . The Washington Post reported growing resentment in the nation towards the United States . An official of the South Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism said that Die Another Day was " the wrong film at the wrong time . " 
 The amount of product placement in the film was a point of criticism , specifically from various news outlets such as the BBC , Time and Reuters who all used the pun " Buy Another Day " . Reportedly 20 companies , paying $ 70 million , had their products featured in the film , a record at the time , although USA Today reported that number to be as high as $ 100 million .

" Michael <unk> of Film <unk> praised the film as the best of the series to star Pierce <unk> and " the most satisfying installment of the franchise in recent memory . " Larry Carroll of <unk> praised Lee <unk> for having " <unk> balanced the film so that it keeps true to the Bond legend , makes reference to the classic films that preceded it , but also <unk> a new <unk> to it all . " Entertainment Weekly magazine also gave a positive reaction , saying that <unk> , " a true filmmaker " , has re @-@ established the series ' pop <unk> . Dana Stevens of The New York Times called the film the best of the James Bond series since The Spy Who Loved Me . Kyle Bell of Movie Freaks 365 stated in his review that the " first half of Die Another Day is classic Bond " , but that " Things start to go <unk> when the ice palace gets introduced . " 
 However , Die Another Day was strongly criticised by some reviewers who felt that the film relied too heavily on <unk> and special effects , with the plot being neglected . James <unk> of <unk> said , " This is a train wreck of an action film – a <unk> attempt by the filmmakers to force @-@ feed James Bond into the mindless <unk> mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud <unk> . " Of the action sequences , he said , " Die Another Day is an exercise in loud explosions and <unk> bad special effects . The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture . Coupled with <unk> production design , Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap . Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as " the seemingly non @-@ stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string . " Roger Moore remarked , " I thought it just went too far – and that ’ s from me , the first Bond in space ! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage ? Please ! "

 Die Another Day was written into a novel by the then @-@ current official James Bond writer , Raymond Benson , based on the screenplay by Neal <unk> and Robert Wade . Fan reaction to it was above average .

She posed nude but for a pair of yellow rubber gloves to promote the show 's launch , and was highly critical of the BBC when the show was cancelled midway through its second series . She has since concluded that " the kind of audience they would like to bring in with shows like Double Yellow aren 't really into watching TV " , but at the time was outspoken against the show 's cancellation , stating : 
 <unk> 's other notable television appearances include the BBC psychological thriller Green @-@ Eyed Monster ( 2001 ) , soap opera <unk> ( 2001 ) , Waking the Dead ( 2001 ) , London 's Burning ( 2001 ) , <unk> ( 2002 ) , Murder in Mind ( 2003 ) , The Canterbury Tales ( 2003 ) and Sea of <unk> ( 2004 ) .

[ ... ] I also like the fact that there were a lot of politically @-@ correct boxes being <unk> , but the writers and producer haven 't been restrained by that . " So , instead of <unk> to this altar , they 've said , ' Okay , we have this family that 's half @-@ black , half @-@ white , half @-@ American , half @-@ British . We have a mix of boys and girls , one character who 's mixed @-@ raced and <unk> – but we 're not going to be restrained by any of that . We 're not going to <unk> around Martha 's disability or anything . ' I liked that . It wasn 't some sort of <unk> hands @-@ off approach to what we 're presenting . " She has also been cast in the film <unk> .

 From 7 February 2006 to 9 December 2008 , <unk> starred in BBC medical drama <unk> City as nurse <unk> Tyson . She had previously appeared in <unk> City 's sister show <unk> , and had made an appearance in <unk> City 's fifth series as patient <unk> Lawson . She was approached about returning to the show in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie <unk> . After a series of three meetings , a year after the birth of her first child , she agreed to assume the role of <unk> , despite being " nervous about signing such a long contract " , stating : " I 've been someone who 's loved the uncertainty of acting . I 've loved that one month it 's <unk> in Morocco and the next I 'm doing a stage play , then it 's a six @-@ part <unk> thing . But last summer I started thinking it would be really nice not to have to look for a job every couple of weeks . It would be nice just to stay put for a while . If I 'm going to be a working mum I 'd rather just be one rather than be one intermittently . And then <unk> came along , so I 'm very grateful " . 
 <unk> signed a three @-@ year contract to play <unk> , and described herself as " very similar " to her character , speaking positively about her working relationship with co @-@ stars Jaye <unk> and Sharon D. Clarke , as well as the " dream " storylines her character was given . She said of the show : 
 " I really love <unk> and I 'm surprised how much . What thrills me about <unk> is that you get back what you put in . The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job . For me it 's about more than turning up and saying the lines . It 's about understanding it and trying to make it better . That 's actually a lot of fun . What 's great is nobody says , ' Just shut up . ' They want you to work at it . [ ... ] I surprise myself sometimes because after two and a half years sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think , ' do I want to do something else ? ' but I really like this job , I never get that awful ‘ <unk> ’ feeling when you really don ’ t want to go into work . " 
 In October 2008 , <unk> announced that she would be departing from <unk> City in order to have a second child , stating : " I 've had a great time and I 'll miss it . I made the decision purely because I was pregnant , but I wasn 't really ready to put down the character of <unk> . I 'm very sorry to have to let her go . "

 Throughout her career , <unk> has been outspoken on the subject of racial discrimination in the entertainment industry . Describing her motivation , she states : " I am not an overtly political person . I just want fairness " . <unk> believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts , explaining ; " If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors . [ ... ] They are not being sold as a reason to watch . " She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin , stating : " I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [ ... ] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it 's still very low and expectations are still very low " . She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem , explaining that : " I get offered a lot of very different roles , but they 're never Welsh . [ ... ] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales , but I know if that series had been called <unk> Park or <unk> Close I wouldn 't have been in it " . In 2001 , <unk> founded a production company and directed a short film entitled <unk> 's <unk> . She presented the film at the Cannes film festival , using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre , films and television . The project , however , was largely unsuccessful , with <unk> stating : " it just made me decide that if there 's anything I don 't want to do , it 's produce films , because I 'm rubbish at it . I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end . " In 2008 , <unk> offered her support to the Action for Southern Africa campaign <unk> ! Period , aiming to provide affordable <unk> protection to <unk> women .
