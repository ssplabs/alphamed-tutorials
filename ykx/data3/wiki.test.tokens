 According to <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the people of Rome celebrated the death of <unk> . <unk> , though , describes a more complicated political environment . <unk> mentions that <unk> 's death was welcomed by Senators , nobility and the upper class . The lower @-@ class , slaves , <unk> of the arena and the theater , and " those who were supported by the famous excesses of <unk> " , on the other hand , were upset with the news . Members of the military were said to have mixed feelings , as they had allegiance to <unk> , but were <unk> to overthrow him . 
 Eastern sources , namely <unk> II and <unk> of <unk> , mention that <unk> 's death was <unk> as he " restored the liberties of <unk> with a wisdom and <unk> quite alien to his character " and that he " held our liberties in his hand and respected them . " 
 Modern scholarship generally holds that , while the Senate and more well @-@ off individuals welcomed <unk> 's death , the general populace was " loyal to the end and beyond , for <unk> and <unk> both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia . " 
 <unk> 's name was erased from some monuments , in what Edward <unk> regards as an " outburst of private zeal " . Many portraits of <unk> were reworked to represent other figures ; according to Eric R. <unk> , over fifty such images survive . This reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously ( see <unk> <unk> ) . <unk> , however , doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of <unk> long after his death . 
 The civil war during the year of the Four <unk> was described by ancient historians as a <unk> period . According to <unk> , this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline , as <unk> and those before him could . <unk> began his short reign with the execution of many allies of <unk> and possible future enemies . One such notable enemy included <unk> <unk> , who claimed to be the son of Emperor <unk> . 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend of <unk> 's and resembled him somewhat in temperament . It was said that the common Roman hailed <unk> as <unk> himself . <unk> used " <unk> " as a surname and <unk> many statues to <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> began his reign with a large funeral for <unk> complete with songs written by <unk> . 
 After <unk> 's suicide in 68 , there was a widespread belief , especially in the eastern provinces , that he was not dead and somehow would return . This belief came to be known as the <unk> <unk> Legend . 
 The legend of <unk> 's return lasted for hundreds of years after <unk> 's death . Augustine of <unk> wrote of the legend as a popular belief in 422 . 
 At least three <unk> <unk> emerged leading rebellions . The first , who sang and played the <unk> or <unk> and whose face was similar to that of the dead emperor , appeared in 69 during the reign of <unk> . After persuading some to recognize him , he was captured and executed . <unk> during the reign of Titus ( 79 – 81 ) , another <unk> appeared in Asia and sang to the accompaniment of the <unk> and looked like <unk> but he , too , was killed . Twenty years after <unk> 's death , during the reign of <unk> , there was a third <unk> . He was supported by the <unk> , who only <unk> gave him up , and the matter almost came to war .

 In his book The Lives of the Twelve <unk> , <unk> describes <unk> as " about the average height , his body marked with spots and <unk> , his hair light blonde , his features regular rather than attractive , his eyes blue and somewhat weak , his neck over thick , his belly prominent , and his legs very slender .

 = = Historiography = = 
 
 The history of <unk> 's reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with <unk> . These first histories at one time did exist and were described as biased and <unk> , either overly critical or praising of <unk> . The original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events . Nonetheless , these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on <unk> written by the next generations of historians . A few of the contemporary historians are known by name . <unk> <unk> , <unk> Rufus and Pliny the Elder all wrote condemning histories on <unk> that are now lost . There were also pro @-@ <unk> histories , but it is unknown who wrote them or for what <unk> <unk> was praised . 
 The bulk of what is known of <unk> comes from <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , who were all of the <unk> class . <unk> and <unk> wrote their histories on <unk> over fifty years after his death , while <unk> <unk> wrote his history over 150 years after <unk> 's death . These sources contradict on a number of events in <unk> 's life including the death of Claudius , the death of <unk> , and the Roman fire of 64 , but they are consistent in their condemnation of <unk> . 
 A handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on <unk> . Few surviving sources paint <unk> in a favourable light . Some sources , though , portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the Roman people , especially in the east .

 <unk> <unk> ( c . 155 – <unk> ) was the son of <unk> <unk> , a Roman senator . He passed the greater part of his life in public service . He was a senator under <unk> and governor of <unk> after the death of Septimius <unk> ; and afterwards <unk> consul around 205 , and also <unk> in Africa and <unk> . 
 Books 61 – 63 of <unk> 's Roman History describe the reign of <unk> . Only fragments of these books remain and what does remain was abridged and altered by John <unk> , an 11th @-@ century monk . 
 <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> ( c . 40 – 120 ) , a Greek philosopher and historian , wrote the Roman people were very happy with <unk> and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely . They <unk> for his rule once he was gone and embraced <unk> when they appeared : 
 Indeed the truth about this has not come out even yet ; for so far as the rest of his subjects were concerned , there was nothing to prevent his continuing to be Emperor for all time , seeing that even now everybody wishes he were still alive . And the great majority do believe that he still is , although in a certain sense he has died not once but often along with those who had been firmly convinced that he was still alive . 
 <unk> 
 <unk> ( c . 55 – 135 ) was the slave to <unk> 's <unk> <unk> . He makes a few passing negative comments on <unk> 's character in his work , but makes no remarks on the nature of his rule . He describes <unk> as a spoiled , angry and unhappy man . 
 <unk> 
 The historian <unk> ( c . 37 – 100 ) , while calling <unk> a <unk> , was also the first to mention bias against <unk> . Of other historians , he said : 
 But I <unk> any further discourse about these affairs ; for there have been a great many who have composed the history of <unk> ; some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favour , as having received benefits from him ; while others , out of hatred to him , and the great ill @-@ will which they bore him , have so <unk> <unk> against him with their lies , that they <unk> deserve to be condemned . Nor do I wonder at such as have told lies of <unk> , since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time , even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred , since those writers lived a long time after them . 
 <unk> 
 Though more of a poet than historian , <unk> ( c . 39 – 65 ) has one of the <unk> accounts of <unk> 's rule . He writes of peace and prosperity under <unk> in contrast to previous war and <unk> . Ironically , he was later involved in a conspiracy to overthrow <unk> and was executed . 
 <unk> 
 <unk> II " the <unk> " ( c . 172 – 250 ) spoke of <unk> in the Life of <unk> <unk> ( Books 4 – 5 ) . Though he has a generally bad or dim view of <unk> , he speaks of others ' positive reception of <unk> in the East . 
 Pliny the Elder 
 The history of <unk> by Pliny the Elder ( c . 24 – 79 ) did not survive . Still , there are several references to <unk> in Pliny 's Natural <unk> . Pliny has one of the worst opinions of <unk> and calls him an " enemy of mankind . " 
 <unk> 
 <unk> ( c . 46 – 127 ) mentions <unk> indirectly in his account of the Life of <unk> and the Life of <unk> . <unk> is portrayed as a <unk> , but those that replace him are not described as better . 
 Seneca the Younger 
 It is not surprising that Seneca ( c . 4 BC – 65 ) , <unk> 's teacher and advisor , writes very well of <unk> . 
 <unk> 
 <unk> ( c . 69 – 130 ) was a member of the <unk> order , and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence . While in this position , <unk> started writing biographies of the emperors , <unk> the <unk> and sensational aspects . 
 <unk> 
 The Annals by <unk> ( c . 56 – 117 ) is the most detailed and comprehensive history on the rule of <unk> , despite being incomplete after the year 66 . <unk> described the rule of the Julio @-@ <unk> emperors as generally unjust . He also thought that existing writing on them was <unk> : 
 The histories of <unk> , <unk> , Claudius and <unk> , while they were in power , were falsified through terror , and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred . 
 <unk> was the son of a <unk> , who married into the elite family of <unk> . He entered his political life as a senator after <unk> 's death and , by <unk> ' own admission , owed much to <unk> 's rivals . <unk> that this bias may be apparent to others , <unk> protests that his writing is true .

 At the end of 66 , conflict broke out between Greeks and Jews in Jerusalem and Caesarea . According to the Talmud , <unk> went to Jerusalem and shot arrows in all four directions . All the arrows landed in the city . He then asked a passing child to repeat the verse he had learned that day . The child responded , " I will lay my vengeance upon <unk> by the hand of my people Israel " ( <unk> . 25 @,@ 14 ) . <unk> became <unk> , believing that God wanted the Temple in Jerusalem to be destroyed , but would punish the one to carry it out . <unk> said , " He desires to lay waste His House and to lay the blame on me , " whereupon he fled and converted to Judaism to avoid such <unk> . <unk> was then dispatched to put down the rebellion . 
 The Talmud adds that the sage <unk> <unk> Baal <unk> , Rabbi <unk> or Rabbi <unk> Baal <unk> ( Rabbi <unk> the miracle maker ) was a Jewish sage who lived in the time of the <unk> a prominent supporter of the Bar <unk> rebellion against Roman rule .

 Non @-@ Christian historian <unk> describes <unk> extensively <unk> and executing Christians after the fire of 64 . <unk> also mentions <unk> punishing Christians , though he does so because they are " given to a new and mischievous superstition " and does not connect it with the fire . 
 Christian writer <unk> ( c . 155 – 230 ) was the first to call <unk> the first <unk> of Christians . He wrote , " <unk> your records . There you will find that <unk> was the first that persecuted this doctrine " . <unk> ( c . 240 – 320 ) also said that <unk> " first persecuted the servants of God " . as does <unk> <unk> . However , <unk> writes that , " since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of <unk> , he [ emperor Claudius ] expelled them from Rome " ( " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ) . These expelled " Jews " may have been early Christians , although <unk> is not explicit .

 The first text to suggest that <unk> ordered the execution of an <unk> is a letter by Clement to the <unk> traditional dated to around 96 <unk> The <unk> Ascension of Isaiah , a Christian writing from the 2nd century says , " the <unk> of his mother , who himself ( even ) this king , will <unk> the plant which the Twelve Apostles of the Beloved have planted . Of the Twelve one will be delivered into his hands " was interpreted to mean <unk> . 
 Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea ( c . 275 – <unk> ) was the first to write explicitly that Paul was beheaded in Rome during the reign of <unk> . He states that <unk> 's persecution led to Peter and Paul 's deaths , but that <unk> did not give any specific orders . However , several other accounts going back to the 1st century have Paul surviving his two years in Rome and travelling to <unk> , before facing trial in Rome again prior to his death . 
 Peter is first said to have been <unk> upside @-@ down in Rome during <unk> 's reign ( but not by <unk> ) in the <unk> Acts of Peter ( c . 200 ) . The account ends with Paul still alive and <unk> <unk> by God 's command not to <unk> any more Christians .

 The <unk> <unk> , Book 5 and 8 , written in the 2nd century , speak of <unk> returning and bringing destruction . Within Christian communities , these writings , along with others , fueled the belief that <unk> would return as the <unk> . In 310 , <unk> wrote that <unk> " suddenly disappeared , and even the burial place of that <unk> wild beast was nowhere to be seen . This has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that , having been conveyed to a distant region , he is still reserved alive ; and to him they apply the <unk> verses " , <unk> maintains that it is not right to believe this . 
 In 422 , Augustine of <unk> wrote about 2 <unk> 2 : 1 – 11 , where he believed Paul mentioned the coming of the <unk> . Though he rejects the theory , Augustine mentions that many Christians believed that <unk> was the <unk> or would return as the <unk> . He wrote , " so that in saying , ' For the mystery of <unk> <unk> already work , ' he alluded to <unk> , whose <unk> already seemed to be as the <unk> of <unk> . " 
 Some modern biblical scholars such as <unk> <unk> ( Johns Hopkins University ) of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the editors of the Oxford & Harper Collins Study Bibles , contend that the number <unk> in the Book of Revelation is a code for <unk> , a view that is also supported in Roman Catholic Biblical commentaries . 
 The concept of <unk> as the <unk> is often a central belief of <unk> <unk> .

 Manila ( / <unk> / ) is the capital city of the Philippines , founded on June 24 , <unk> by Spanish <unk> Miguel López de <unk> . It is one of the oldest cities in the country and was the seat of power for most of the colonial rules of the Philippines . It is situated on the eastern shore of Manila Bay and contains a multitude of landmarks , some of which date back to the 16th century , such as the Spanish colonial era <unk> City of <unk> . 
 Manila is the second most populous city in the Philippines after the former capital <unk> City with a population of 1 @,@ 780 @,@ 148 in 2015 . Because of its small land area and huge population , Manila is regarded as one of the most densely populated cities in the world with 42 @,@ <unk> people per square kilometer . Manila is one of the sixteen cities and a municipality that make up Metro Manila , the National Capital Region of the Philippines . In 2012 , <unk> and World Cities Research Network listed Manila as a global city . 
 Manila has six representative districts for the lower house of the Philippine Congress . Furthermore , the city is composed of 16 districts , namely : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Port Area , <unk> , <unk> , San Andres , San Miguel , San Nicolas , Santa <unk> , Santa Cruz , Santa Mesa and <unk> . 
 The Kingdom of <unk> once ruled in the vicinity of Manila before it briefly became a province of the Hindu <unk> Empire . During the <unk> invasion of the Philippines , Sultan <unk> of <unk> captured <unk> ( a village in modern @-@ day Manila ) and renamed it <unk> , a <unk> term referring to the presence of the <unk> shrub . <unk> was a vassal state of <unk> , established to <unk> <unk> . <unk> had been <unk> since the sixth century CE and earlier . It had become partly Islamic and Hindu @-@ <unk> by the 15th century CE . 
 In <unk> Spanish <unk> arrived from Mexico , from across the Pacific , and founded present @-@ day Manila in what today is <unk> . Spanish missionaries soon <unk> the city and incorporated <unk> under Manila and then built some of the oldest churches in the country , including San Agustin Church . The <unk> renamed the area <unk> <unk> de <unk> ( New Kingdom of <unk> ) and shortened the name to Manila . 
 Manila became the center of Spanish activity in the Far East and one end of the Manila @-@ Acapulco <unk> trade route , linking Spanish America with Asia , one of the earliest examples of <unk> . Due to the central location in the Pacific sea trade routes , Manila received the moniker of the " Pearl of the <unk> " . Spanish rule of Manila and the entire Philippine archipelago lasted for over three centuries , until 1898 . At different times during the long Spanish period there were local <unk> , Chinese <unk> , massive pirate attacks , great earthquakes , Dutch raids and invasion attempts , and a British occupation of the city during their unsuccessful attempt to conquer the Philippines . Order was usually quickly restored and the city returned to the business of trade . In the 19th century Manila was one of the most modern cities in Asia . Before the Spanish – American War , Manila saw the rise of the Philippine Revolution . Under the American rule following the Spanish – American War , the United States changed the official language from Spanish to English and made some changes in education , local laws and urban planning . Towards the end of World War II , during the Battle of Manila most of the city was flattened by intensive aerial bombardment by the United States Air Force . As a result , relatively little remains of Manila 's prewar and colonial architecture , although there are ongoing restoration projects , especially within the old walled city , <unk> .

 The earliest evidence of human life in and around the area of Manila is the nearby <unk> <unk> dated to around 3000 BC . Furthermore , <unk> , a class of <unk> peoples , became the aboriginal inhabitants of the Philippines . They were found across Luzon before the <unk> @-@ <unk> migrated in and assimilated them . 
 The Kingdom of <unk> flourished during the latter half of the Ming Dynasty as a result of direct trade relations with China . <unk> district was maintained as the traditional capital of the empire , with its rulers as sovereign kings and not mere chieftains , and were addressed variously as <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> in <unk> ( " lords " ) ; <unk> <unk> ( " son of heaven " ) ; or <unk> ( " lord of the palace " ) , the Emperor of China considered the <unk> ( rulers of ancient Manila ) " <unk> " ( Kings ) . 
 In the 13th century , Manila consisted of a fortified settlement and trading quarter at the shores of the <unk> River , on top of previous older towns . Manila was then settled by the <unk> empire of <unk> as referenced in the epic <unk> poem <unk> which inscribed its conquest by <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> " <unk> ् <unk> ् " which is a historical name for the city of Manila is listed in <unk> 14 alongside <unk> , which is now <unk> , and <unk> . 
 During the reign of Sultan <unk> from <unk> to <unk> , the <unk> Empire invaded , wanting to take advantage of <unk> 's China trade by attacking its environs and establishing " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( The Kingdom of <unk> ) . They ruled under and gave yearly tribute to the Sultanate of <unk> as its satellite state . They established a new dynasty under the local leader who accepted Islam and became <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> I. He also established a trading challenge to the already rich House of <unk> <unk> in <unk> . Islam was further strengthened by the arrival of Muslim traders from the Arab @-@ Indian area and Southeast Asia . Manila was temporarily besieged by the invasion of Chinese pirate @-@ warlord <unk> ( <unk> ) but was thwarted by the local inhabitants , before it became the seat of the colonial government of Spain . 
 On June 24 , <unk> , Spanish <unk> Miguel López de <unk> arrived from New Spain ( now Mexico ) , and then exercised rule of the Spanish city of Manila as a territory of New Spain with the establishment of a city council in what today is the district of <unk> . López de <unk> had the local royalty executed or exiled , after the failure of the <unk> <unk> ; a plot wherein an alliance between Japanese merchants , Luzon 's <unk> with several <unk> and <unk> plus the <unk> Empire would band together to execute the Spaniards and their Latin @-@ American mercenaries , and <unk> allies . At the conclusion of which , the victorious Spaniards made Manila the capital of the Spanish East Indies and of the Philippines , which the empire would control for the next three centuries , from <unk> to 1898 . 
 Manila then became famous during the Manila @-@ Acapulco <unk> trade which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from Europe , Africa and Latin America across the Pacific Islands to Southeast Asia ( Which was already an <unk> for goods coming from India , Indonesia and China ) and trade also flowed vice versa . Silver that was mined in Mexico and Peru were exchanged for Chinese silk , Indian gems , and the spices of the Southeast Asia , some of which even flowed to Europe . Likewise wines and olives grown from Europe and North Africa were <unk> via Mexico towards Manila . 
 Manila was occupied by British forces for twenty months , from <unk> to 1764 , and used as a base for an unsuccessful attempt to conquer the Philippines during the Seven Years ' War . Eventually , the British withdrew from Manila as per agreements in the 1763 Treaty of Paris . The Chinese were punished for supporting the British invasion , and the small fortress @-@ city of <unk> , mostly populated by Europeans and <unk> , kept its cannons pointed at <unk> , the world 's oldest <unk> . 
 Mexican Independence in 1821 necessitated direct rule from Spain . Under direct Spanish rule , banking , industry and education flourished more than it had in the previous two centuries . The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain . 
 The growing wealth and education attracted indigenous , Chinese , Indians , <unk> , and Europeans from the provinces to Manila , all of whom elected a nascent <unk> citizenship regardless of ethnicity . The developments also facilitated the rise of an <unk> class which <unk> liberal ideas , the ideological foundations of the Philippine Revolution which sought independence from Spain . 
 After the Battle of Manila ( 1898 ) , Spain ceded the surrendered city of Manila to the United States . The First Philippine Republic based at nearby <unk> fought against the Americans for control of the city of Manila . The Americans defeated the First Philippine Republic and captured president Emilio <unk> who announced allegiance to the United States on April 1 , 1901 . 
 Upon drafting a new charter for Manila in June 1901 , the Americans made official what had long been tacit : that the City of Manila was not <unk> alone but also all its <unk> . The new city charter proclaimed that Manila was composed of eleven municipal districts — presumably <unk> , <unk> , Santa Cruz , <unk> , San Miguel , <unk> , Santa <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . In addition to these , the Church recognized five parishes as <unk> — namely , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> , Santa Mesa and <unk> . Later times would add two more : <unk> and San Andres <unk> . 
 Under American control , a new civilian oriented Insular Government headed by then Governor @-@ General William Howard Taft invited city <unk> Daniel <unk> for the transformation of Manila , to adapt the old city to changed times and modern needs . The <unk> Plan included development of the road system , the use of waterways for transportation , and <unk> of Manila with the improvement of <unk> , construction of parks , <unk> and various building for various activities . 
 The latter included a government center occupying all of Wallace Field , which extends from <unk> to the present Taft Avenue . The Philippine Capitol was to rise at the Taft Avenue end of the field , facing toward the sea , and would form , with the buildings of different government <unk> and departments , a <unk> , <unk> in the center , and a monument to José <unk> at its <unk> end . Of <unk> 's proposed government center , only three units — the Legislative Building and the building of the Finance and Agricultural departments — were completed when World War II erupted . 
 Due to the Japanese occupation of the Philippines , American soldiers were ordered to withdraw from the city and all military installations were removed on December 24 , 1941 . General Douglas MacArthur declared Manila an open city to prevent further death and destruction ; despite this , the Japanese <unk> continued to bomb the city . Manila was occupied by the Japanese forces on January 2 , 1942 . 
 Manila was also the site of the <unk> battle in the Pacific theater during the Second World War . After falling to the Empire of Japan on January 2 , 1942 , it was recaptured by joint American and <unk> troops from February 3 to March 3 , 1945 . Some 100 @,@ 000 civilians were killed in Manila in February 1945 . It was the second most devastated city in the world after Warsaw during the Second World War . At the end of World War II , almost all of the structures in the city , particularly <unk> , were destroyed but after the war , reconstruction took place . 
 In 1948 , President <unk> <unk> moved the seat of government of the Philippines to <unk> City , a new capital city in the suburbs and fields northeast of Manila , created in 1938 by former President Manuel L. <unk> , which was named after him . The move ended any implementation of the <unk> Plan 's intent for the government centre to be at <unk> . 
 With the <unk> @-@ born <unk> <unk> as its first elected mayor in 1952 ( all mayors were appointed prior to this ) , Manila underwent The Golden Age , once again earning its status as the " Pearl of the <unk> " , a moniker it earned before the Second World War . After <unk> 's term in the 1950s , Manila was led by Antonio <unk> for most of the 1960s . Ramon <unk> ( an Indian @-@ <unk> ) was mayor for nearly the entire 1970s until the 1986 People Power Revolution . <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are often collectively considered as the " Big Three of Manila " less for their rather long <unk> as the city 's chief executive ( continuously for over three decades , from 1952 – 1986 ) , but more for their <unk> contribution to the development and progress of the city and their lasting legacy in <unk> the quality of life and welfare of the people of Manila . 
 During the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos , the region of the Metro Manila was created as an integrated unit with the enactment of Presidential <unk> No. <unk> on November 7 , 1975 . The area encompassed four cities and thirteen adjoining towns , as a separate regional unit of government . On the <unk> anniversary of the city 's foundation on June 24 , 1976 , Manila was reinstated by Marcos as the capital of the Philippines for its historical significance as the seat of government since the Spanish Period . Presidential <unk> No. 940 states that Manila has always been to the <unk> people and in the eyes of the world , the premier city of the Philippines being the center of trade , commerce , education and culture . 
 During the martial law era , Manila became a hot @-@ bed of resistance activity as youth and student demonstrators repeatedly clashed with the police and military which were <unk> to the Marcos regime . After decades of resistance , the non @-@ violent People Power Revolution ( predecessor to the peaceful @-@ <unk> that toppled the iron @-@ curtain in Europe ) , ousted the authoritarian Marcos from power . 
 In 1992 , <unk> Lim was elected mayor , the first Chinese @-@ <unk> to hold the office . He was known for his anti @-@ crime <unk> . Lim was succeeded by <unk> <unk> , who served as his vice @-@ mayor . <unk> was known for his campaign ( and city slogan ) " <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( <unk> Manila ) , which saw the establishment of several parks and the repair and rehabilitation of the city 's deteriorating facilities . He was the city 's mayor for 3 terms ( 9 years ) before being termed out of office . 
 <unk> Lim once again ran for mayor and defeated <unk> 's son Ali in the 2007 city election and immediately reversed all of <unk> 's projects claiming <unk> 's projects made little contribution to the improvements of the city . The relationship of both parties turned bitter , with the two <unk> again during the 2010 city elections in which Lim won against <unk> . 
 Lim was sued by <unk> Dennis <unk> on 2008 over human rights , charged with <unk> over the rehabilitation of public schools , and was heavily criticized for his <unk> resolution of the <unk> Park hostage taking incident , one of the deadliest hostage crisis in the Philippines . Later on , Vice Mayor <unk> <unk> and 28 city <unk> filed another case against Lim in 2012 , stating that Lim 's statement in a meeting were " life @-@ threatening " to them . On the 2013 elections , former President Joseph <unk> defeated Lim in the mayoral race .

It operates 59 health centers and six city @-@ run hospitals , which are free of charge . The six public city @-@ run hospitals are the <unk> <unk> <unk> Medical Center , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> Andres <unk> Memorial Medical Center , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> . <unk> Hospital , and Justice Jose <unk> Santos General Hospital . Manila is also the site of the Philippine General Hospital , the tertiary state @-@ owned hospital administered and operated by the University of the Philippines Manila . 
 Manila 's healthcare is also provided by private corporations . Private hospitals that operates in the city are the Manila Doctors Hospital , Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center , Dr. José R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center , Metropolitan Medical Center , Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital , and the University of Santo Tomas Hospital . 
 The Department of Health has its main office in Manila . The national health department also operates the San <unk> Hospital , a special referral tertiary hospital . Manila is also the home to the headquarters of the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific and the World Health Organization Country Office for the Philippines . 
 
 = = Education = = 
 
 The center of education since the colonial period , Manila — particularly <unk> — is home to several Philippine universities and colleges as well as its oldest ones . It served as the home of the University of Santo Tomas ( 1611 ) , <unk> de San Juan de <unk> ( 1620 ) , <unk> de Manila University ( 1859 ) , Lyceum of the Philippines University and the <unk> Institute of Technology . Only <unk> de San Juan de <unk> ( 1620 ) remains at <unk> ; the University of Santo Tomas transferred to a new campus at <unk> in 1927 , and <unk> left <unk> for Loyola Heights , <unk> City ( while still retaining " de Manila " in its name ) in 1952 . 
 The University of the City of Manila ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) located at <unk> , and <unk> de Manila located just outside the walled city , are both owned and operated by the Manila city government . The national government controls the University of the Philippines Manila , the oldest of the University of the Philippines constituent universities and the center of health sciences education in the country . The city is also the site of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines , the largest university in the country in terms of student population . 
 The University Belt refers to the area where there is a high concentration or a cluster of colleges and universities in the city and it is commonly understood as the one where the San Miguel , <unk> and <unk> districts meet . Generally , it includes the western end of <unk> Boulevard , <unk> Reyes St. ( formerly <unk> St. ) , the eastern end of <unk> M. <unk> Avenue ( formerly <unk> ) , <unk> Avenue , <unk> Street , and the different side streets . Each of the colleges and universities found here are at a short walking distance of each other . Another cluster of colleges lies along the southern bank of the <unk> River , mostly at the <unk> and <unk> districts , and still a smaller cluster is found at the southernmost part of <unk> near the border with <unk> such as the private co @-@ educational institution of De La Salle University , the largest of all De La Salle University System of schools . 
 The Division of the City Schools of Manila , a branch of the Department of Education , refers to the city 's three @-@ tier public education system . It governs the 71 public elementary schools , 32 public high schools . 
 The city also contains the Manila Science High School , the pilot science high school of the Philippines ; the National Museum , where the <unk> of Juan <unk> is housed ; the Metropolitan Museum of Manila , a museum of modern and contemporary visual arts ; the <unk> <unk> , the Children 's Museum , a place of hands @-@ on discovery and fun learning ; and , the National Library , the <unk> of the country 's printed and recorded cultural heritage and other literary and information resources .

 <unk> is a large genus of <unk> native to Mexico , the Caribbean , Central and South America . This <unk> <unk> , non @-@ spiny genus includes both small <unk> lacking an <unk> stem and large trees . The genus has a complicated taxonomic history , and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers . Since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male flowers , the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus . This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny . 
 Somewhere between 29 and 67 species are recognised in the genus , with estimates of as many as 100 . <unk> <unk> collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species , or groups of similar species . <unk> species have a long history of human use , and include economically important sources of palm oil and fibre . Many species are fire tolerant and thrive in disturbed habitats . Their seeds are animal dispersed , including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by now @-@ extinct Pleistocene <unk> . 
 
 = = Description = = 
 
 The genus <unk> has <unk> compound leaves — rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather @-@ like or <unk> @-@ like pattern . Species are also non @-@ spiny <unk> and includes both large trees with stout stems up to 30 metres ( 98 ft ) tall and <unk> <unk> ( one which lack an <unk> stem ) . The number of leaves per individual varies from about three to thirty @-@ five ; larger plants tend to have more and longer leaves . 
 <unk> are large , branched and borne among the leaves . The <unk> consists of a main axis — the <unk> and the <unk> — and a series of smaller branches , the <unk> . The <unk> , which bear the flowers , emerge from the <unk> . The <unk> is the main stalk , connecting the <unk> with the stem . <unk> either consist entirely of male flowers , or are predominantly female with a few male flowers . Fruit usually have two or three seeds , although fewer or more are present in some species , and are usually brown , yellow , orange @-@ brown or purple when mature . 
 Four different types of male flowers exist . On the basis of these flower types , the genus has often been split into four genera — a more narrowly defined <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The species sometimes referred to <unk> have coiled <unk> , while the other groups have straight ones . The <unk> of those placed in <unk> are much shorter than the <unk> , while those placed in <unk> and a more narrowly defined <unk> have <unk> that are longer than the <unk> . Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups ; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus . 
 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 
 <unk> has been placed in the subfamily <unk> , the tribe <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , together with the genera <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Within this <unk> , <unk> has been found to be a monophyletic group , and sister to the clade containing <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 <unk> exists as to whether <unk> should be considered a single genus , or a group of related genera . In their 1996 Field Guide to the <unk> of the Americas , Andrew Henderson , Gloria <unk> and <unk> <unk> combined all the species in the <unk> <unk> ( as it was then defined ) into a single genus , <unk> . In his 1999 <unk> Treatment of Palm <unk> <unk> , American botanist Sidney F. <unk> divided the group into five genera — a more narrowly defined <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . <unk> <unk> and John <unk> recognised a single genus in their 2005 World <unk> of <unk> , and Jean @-@ Christophe <unk> continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus . 
 The multi @-@ genus approach is based solely on the structure of the male flowers ; no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another . Four of the genera — <unk> ( in a narrow sense ) , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> — correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus . However , a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types , including A. <unk> ( which <unk> placed in its own genus , <unk> ) and this has been used as an argument for the single @-@ genus approach . In addition , there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under <unk> 's five @-@ genus system , which has also been used as an argument for placing them in a single genus . In 2009 Alan <unk> and colleagues published a molecular phylogeny of the <unk> which found that some species placed in <unk> were actually more closely related to species placed in <unk> than they were to other members of that genus ( if the five @-@ genus approach was used ) , while A. <unk> , placed in <unk> by <unk> , was actually a sister to both <unk> and <unk> . 
 
 = = = History = = = 
 
 The genus <unk> was first described Carl <unk> <unk> in 1816 based on specimens collected by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé <unk> , although older , pre @-@ <unk> descriptions exist , including Charles <unk> 's 1703 description of A. <unk> . The genus was named for <unk> III <unk> , king of <unk> , known for his interest in <unk> plants . The type species is A. <unk> , a Colombian endemic . The genera <unk> and <unk> were described by Carl Friedrich Philipp von <unk> in 1826 and 1837 respectively . <unk> was described by Hermann <unk> in 1857 , and <unk> by <unk> F. Cook in 1942 . 
 
 = = = Species = = = 
 
 Experts disagree about the number of species in the genus <unk> ( broadly defined ) . In 1965 , Dutch <unk> Jan Gerard <unk> Boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus . In their 1996 Field Guide to the <unk> of the Americas Andrew Henderson and <unk> recognised 29 species in the genus , while Sidney <unk> recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group . Largely following <unk> 's lead , <unk> <unk> and John <unk> recognised 67 species in their 2005 World <unk> of <unk> . An important element of this disagreement is the decision by <unk> to define species more narrowly than Henderson . As a result , what Henderson interpreted as variation within species , <unk> took as differences between <unk> similar species . This problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in <unk> collections . The large size of the leaves , inflorescences and fruit of many <unk> species makes them difficult to collect . In addition , many important collections , including type specimen , have been lost or destroyed . <unk> or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species . 
 The three recent treatments ( Henderson and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> ) recognised a total of 73 species , but only 20 species are accepted by all of them . The remainder account for either nine species or more than 40 . For example , what Andrew Henderson considered a single species , <unk> <unk> , other authors have considered a species complex consisting of four or five species . <unk> doubted the validity of A. <unk> as a species , and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to A. <unk> — A. <unk> , A. <unk> , A. <unk> and A. <unk> . <unk> and <unk> accepted both <unk> 's four species and A. <unk> . However , Jean @-@ Christophe <unk> was of the opinion that A. <unk> , A. <unk> and A. <unk> were all very similar , and thought it likely that they all represented the same species . 
 Another species complex in <unk> includes A. <unk> and related species . Henderson ( 1995 ) recognised A. <unk> and A. <unk> , considering the latter to either be an <unk> form of A. <unk> or a hybrid between it and A. <unk> . <unk> and <unk> accepted A. <unk> , but <unk> considered it a dubious taxon . <unk> <unk> was recognised as a distinct species by Michael <unk> and <unk> ; <unk> and <unk> and <unk> concurred , but Henderson considered it part of A. <unk> . <unk> also described a fourth member of this group , A. <unk> , and it is accepted by <unk> and <unk> . 
 
 = = Reproduction and growth = = 
 
 <unk> species are <unk> — male and female flowers are separate , but are borne by the same plant . Various species have been described as being insect @-@ <unk> , including A. <unk> , while <unk> in A. <unk> and A. <unk> , has been attributed both to insects and wind . 
 <unk> <unk> is remote tubular — during <unk> , as the <unk> expands it pushes the young shoot away from the seed . After <unk> , the stem initially grows downward before turning to grow upward and produce the <unk> stem . This produces a " saxophone shaped " <unk> portion of the stem . The fact that the shoot tips of <unk> seedlings are underground it likely to contribute to their fire @-@ tolerance . 
 
 = = Distribution = = 
 
 Species range across the <unk> from Mexico in the north to Bolivia , Paraguay , and southern Brazil in the south . According to <unk> and <unk> , three species are found in Mexico , four in Central America , and 62 in South America . Three species are present in the Caribbean — two in Trinidad and <unk> , along the southern edge of the region , and one in Haiti . 
 
 = = Habitat and ecology = = 
 
 <unk> includes both large trees and small <unk> <unk> which occupy a number of different ecological niches . <unk> stands of some of the larger species are conspicuous elements on the landscape , while smaller species are found in both in the forest <unk> and in <unk> . 
 <unk> has been implicated in the formation of vegetation dominated by large <unk> species . In seasonally dry <unk> forests the density of large adult A. <unk> <unk> was correlated with canopy <unk> ; the species also dominates <unk> formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and <unk> . <unk> <unk> forms pure stands in many parts of Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared . Similarly , stands of A. <unk> in <unk> , Brazil ( which are cultivated for <unk> fibre ) are managed using fire — the seedlings survive cutting and burning , and are able to dominate burned forest patches . 
 The fruit are dispersed by animals ; fruit which are not dispersed frequently suffer seed predation by <unk> beetles . Certain species of <unk> have been mentioned as examples of " <unk> " species which are adapted for dispersal by now @-@ extinct Pleistocene <unk> . On <unk> Island , <unk> , in the Brazilian Amazon , <unk> <unk> fruit were consumed by <unk> , <unk> <unk> , deer and <unk> . <unk> , including <unk> , fed upon the fruit and , as the fruit availability declined , they fed on the seeds . Other <unk> of <unk> fruit include <unk> <unk> which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds of A. <unk> in the Brazilian <unk> .

 <unk> species have a long history of human <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> seeds have been found in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to 9000 BP . A variety of species remain important sources of edible oil , <unk> , edible seeds and fibre . The leaves of <unk> <unk> and A. <unk> are used extensively for <unk> . Several species are oil <unk> , with A. <unk> among the most important economically . <unk> extracted from A. <unk> were reported to support over 300 @,@ 000 households in the Brazilian state of <unk> in 2005 , and in 1985 it was estimated to support over 450 @,@ 000 households throughout the Brazil . <unk> fibres , extracted from the leaf bases of A. <unk> , are commercially important , and generated about US $ 20 million in annual income to Brazilian farmers in 1996 .

 The film was the final production and release of the Thanhouser Company and it was to be released through <unk> . Numerous factors would play into the winding down and eventual closing of the Thanhouser Film Corporation with much advance notice by Edwin Thanhouser . Q. David Bowers writes that it was easy to understand Thanhouser 's decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through <unk> were based on their decision to release or <unk> the work , the New Rochelle studio was 2 @,@ 500 miles from the center of the trade activity and the slump in industry tied to World War I. Weeks before the film was released , Variety told of the winding down of the Thanhouser with the studio 's staff consisting of Edwin Thanhouser and the <unk> , <unk> B. Bishop . The article concluded with the announcement that Lloyd F. Lonergan , the scenario writer of the company , had retired from the company .

 The five reel film was released through the <unk> Exchange as a <unk> Gold Rooster Play on October 7 , 1917 . Charles E. Wagner of the <unk> 's Trade Review found it to be a good film with great direction and photography , but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared to be involved in the accident was too real . Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual <unk> ; which should prove a strong program for the <unk> program . Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph found it to be an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences , but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer . A reviewer for the The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film 's excessive use of <unk> meetings to be highly <unk> , but found <unk> 's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances . The reviewer said that Emile <unk> had made the <unk> story more plausible . 
 Like many American films of the time , The Heart of Ezra Greer was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards . The Chicago Board of <unk> required the cutting in <unk> 2 of a letter stating , " I cannot face my father , " etc . , and two <unk> of gambling scenes ; and in <unk> 5 a change of the <unk> " Because it means her whole future " to " Because she is his wife " . 
 
 
 = Free Derry = 
 
 Free Derry ( Irish : <unk> <unk> ) was a self @-@ declared autonomous nationalist area of Derry , Northern Ireland , that existed between 1969 and 1972 . Its name was taken from a sign painted on a gable wall in the <unk> in January 1969 which read , " You are now entering Free Derry " . The area , which included the <unk> and <unk> neighbourhoods , was secured by community activists for the first time on 5 January 1969 following an incursion into the <unk> by members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( <unk> ) . Residents built barricades and carried clubs and similar arms to prevent the <unk> from entering . After six days the residents took down the barricades and <unk> patrols resumed , but tensions remained high over the following months . 
 Violence reached a peak on 12 August 1969 , culminating in the Battle of the <unk> — a three @-@ day pitched battle between residents and the <unk> . On 14 August units of the British Army were deployed at the edge of the <unk> and the <unk> were withdrawn . The Derry Citizens Defence Association ( <unk> ) declared their intention to hold the area against both the <unk> and the British Army until their demands were met . The British Army made no attempt to enter the area . The situation continued until October 1969 when , following publication of the Hunt Report , military police were allowed in . 
 The Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) began to re @-@ arm and recruit after August 1969 . In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA . Both were supported by the people of the Free Derry area . Meanwhile , relations between the British Army and the nationalist community , which were initially good , deteriorated . In July 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the IRA after two young men were shot and killed by British troops . The government introduced <unk> on 9 August 1971 , and in response , barricades went up once more in the <unk> and <unk> . This time , Free Derry was a no @-@ go area , defended by armed members of both the Official and Provisional IRA . From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army , and the <unk> began a bombing campaign in the city centre . As before , unarmed ' <unk> ' manned the barricades , and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police . 
 Support for the IRA increased further after Bloody Sunday in January 1972 , when thirteen unarmed men and boys were shot dead by the British Army 's Parachute Regiment at a march in the <unk> ( a 14th man was wounded and died 4 ½ months later ) . The support began to <unk> after the killing by the Official IRA of a local youth who was home on leave from the British Army . After a Provisional IRA ceasefire , during which it entered talks with the British government , broke down , the British took the decision to move against the " no @-@ go " areas . Free Derry came to an end on 31 July 1972 , when thousands of British troops moved in with armoured cars and <unk> to occupy the area . 
 
 = = Background = = 
 
 Derry City lies near the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland . It has a majority nationalist population , and nationalists won a majority of seats in the 1920 local elections . Despite this , the Ulster Unionist Party controlled the local council , <unk> Corporation , from 1923 onwards . The <unk> maintained their majority , firstly , by manipulating the constituency boundaries ( <unk> ) so that the South Ward , with a nationalist majority , returned eight councillors while the much smaller North Ward and <unk> Ward , with unionist <unk> , returned twelve councillors between them ; <unk> , by allowing only <unk> to vote in local elections , rather than one man , one vote , so that a higher number of nationalists , who did not own homes , were disenfranchised ; and <unk> , by denying houses to nationalists outside the South Ward constituency . The result was that there were about 2 @,@ 000 nationalist families , and practically no unionists , on the housing waiting list , and that housing in the nationalist area was crowded and of a very poor condition . The South Ward comprised the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Bishop Street and Foyle Road , and it was this area that would become Free Derry . 
 The Derry Housing Action Committee ( <unk> ) was formed in March 1968 by members of the Derry Branch of the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the James <unk> Republican Club , including <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . It disrupted a meeting of <unk> Corporation in March 1968 and in May blocked traffic by placing a caravan that was home to a family of four in the middle of the <unk> Road in the <unk> and staging a sit @-@ down protest at the opening of the second deck of the <unk> Bridge . After the meeting of <unk> Corporation was again disrupted in August , <unk> <unk> telephoned the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association ( <unk> ) and invited them to hold a march in Derry . The date chosen was 5 October 1968 , an <unk> committee was formed ( although in reality most of the organizing was done by <unk> and <unk> ) and the route was to take the <unk> inside the city walls , where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march . The Minister of Home Affairs , William Craig , made an order on 3 October prohibiting the march on the grounds that the <unk> Boys of Derry were intending to hold a march on the same day . In the words of Martin <unk> of <unk> " this particular tactic ... provided the excuse needed to ban the march . " When the <unk> attempted to defy the ban on 5 October they were stopped by a Royal Ulster Constabulary ( <unk> ) cordon . The police drew their <unk> and struck <unk> , including <unk> MP Eddie <unk> and Westminster MP Gerry <unk> . Subsequently the police " broke ranks and used their <unk> <unk> on people in Duke Street " . <unk> trying to escape met another party of police and " these police also used their <unk> <unk> . " Water cannons were also used . The police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of Derry , and at a meeting four days later the Derry Citizens ' Action Committee ( <unk> ) was formed , with John Hume as chairman and Ivan Cooper as vice @-@ chairman .

 Another group formed as a result of the events of 5 October was People 's Democracy , a group of students in Queen 's University Belfast . They organised a march from Belfast to Derry in support of civil rights , starting out with about forty young people on 1 January 1969 . The march met with violent opposition from loyalist counter @-@ demonstrators at several points along the route . Finally , at <unk> Bridge , five miles outside Derry , they were attacked by a mob of about two hundred wielding clubs — some of them studded with nails — and stones . Half of the attackers were later identified from press photographs as members of the B @-@ <unk> . The police , who were at the scene , <unk> to the B @-@ <unk> as they prepared their ambush , and then failed to protect the <unk> , many of whom ran into the river and were <unk> with stones from the bank . Dozens of <unk> were taken to hospital . The remainder continued on to Derry where they were attacked once more on their way to <unk> Bridge before they finally reached Guildhall Square , where they held a rally . <unk> broke out after the rally . Police drove <unk> into the <unk> , but did not come after them . In the early hours of the following morning , 5 January , members of the <unk> charged into St. <unk> 's Wells and <unk> Road in the <unk> , breaking windows and beating residents . In his report on the disturbances , Lord Cameron remarked that " for such conduct among members of a disciplined and well @-@ led force there can be no acceptable justification or excuse " and added that " its effect in <unk> <unk> and inspiring hostility towards the police was <unk> great . " 
 That afternoon over 1 @,@ 500 <unk> residents built barricades , armed themselves with steel bars , wooden clubs and <unk> , and told the police that they would not be allowed into the area . <unk> chairman John Hume told a meeting of residents that they were to defend the area and no @-@ one was to come in . Groups of men wearing <unk> patrolled the streets in shifts . John ' <unk> ' Casey , a local activist , painted " You are now entering Free Derry " in white paint on the gable wall of a house on the corner of <unk> Road and <unk> Street . That corner , which was a popular venue for meetings , later became known as " Free Derry Corner " . On 7 January , the <unk> area was extended to include the <unk> , another nationalist area on a hill overlooking the <unk> . A clandestine radio station calling itself " Radio Free Derry " began broadcasting to residents , playing rebel songs and encouraging resistance . On a small number of occasions law @-@ <unk> attempted crimes , but were dealt with by the patrols . Despite all this , the Irish Times reported that " the infrastructure of revolutionary control in the area has not been developed beyond the maintenance of patrols . " Following some acts of destruction and of violence late in the week , members of the <unk> including Ivan Cooper addressed residents on Friday , 10 January and called on them to <unk> the barricades . The barricades were taken down the following morning . 
 
 = = April 1969 = = 
 
 Over the next three months there were violent clashes , with local youths throwing stones at police . Violence came to a head on Saturday , 19 April after a planned march from <unk> Bridge to the city centre was banned . A protest in the city centre led to clashes with " <unk> " — unionists in sympathy with the anti @-@ civil rights stance of Ian Paisley . Police attempting to drive the protesters back into the <unk> were themselves driven back to their barracks . A series of pitched battles followed , and barricades were built , often under the supervision of <unk> Devlin , newly elected MP for Mid Ulster . Police pursuing <unk> broke into a house in William Street and severely beat the <unk> , Samuel <unk> , his family and two friends . <unk> was brought to hospital " bleeding <unk> from a number of head wounds . " At midnight four hundred <unk> men in full riot gear and carrying riot shields occupied the <unk> . <unk> of police vehicles drove through the area with <unk> <unk> . 
 The following day , several thousand residents , led by the <unk> , withdrew to the <unk> and issued an ultimatum to the <unk> — withdraw within two hours or be driven out . With fifteen minutes of the two hours remaining , the police marched out through the <unk> 's Gate , even as the residents were entering from the far side . The barricades were not maintained on this occasion , and routine patrols were not prevented . 
 Samuel <unk> suffered a heart attack four days after his beating . On 17 July he suffered a further heart attack and died . Thousands attended his funeral , and the mood was sufficiently angry that it was clear the annual <unk> Boys ' parade , scheduled for 12 August , could not take place without causing serious disturbance .

 The <unk> Boys ' parade is an annual celebration by unionists of the relief of the Siege of Derry in 1689 , which began when thirteen young apprentice boys shut the city 's gates against the army of King James . At that time the parade was held on 12 August each year . Participants from across Northern Ireland and Britain marched along the city walls above the <unk> , and were often openly hostile to the residents . On 30 July 1969 the Derry Citizens Defence Association ( <unk> ) was formed to try to preserve peace during the period of the parade , and to defend the <unk> and <unk> in the event of an attack . The chairman was <unk> <unk> , an Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) veteran ; the vice @-@ chairman was Paddy Doherty , a popular local man sometimes known as " Paddy <unk> " and the secretary was <unk> White , another leading republican and leader of the James <unk> Republican Club . Street committees were formed under the overall command of the <unk> and barricades were built on the night of 11 August . The parade took place as planned on 12 August . As it passed through Waterloo Place , on the edge of the <unk> , hostilities began between supporters and opponents of the parade . Fighting between the two groups continued for two hours , then the police joined in . They charged up William Street against the <unk> , followed by the ' <unk> ' . They were met with a hail of stones and petrol bombs . The ensuing battle became known as the Battle of the <unk> . Late in the evening , having been driven back repeatedly , the police fired <unk> of <unk> gas into the crowd . <unk> on the roof of a high @-@ rise block of flats on <unk> Street threw petrol bombs down on the police . <unk> @-@ <unk> were used to maintain contact between different areas of fighting and <unk> headquarters in Paddy Doherty 's house in Westland Street , and first aid stations were operating , staffed by doctors , nurses and volunteers . Women and girls made milk @-@ bottle <unk> of petrol bombs for supply to the youths in the front line and " Radio Free Derry " broadcast to the fighters and their families . On the third day of fighting , 14 August , the Northern Ireland Government mobilised the Ulster Special Constabulary ( B @-@ <unk> ) , a force greatly feared by nationalists in Derry and elsewhere . Before they engaged , however , British troops were deployed at the scene , carrying automatic rifles and sub @-@ machine guns . The <unk> and B @-@ <unk> withdrew , and the troops took up positions outside the <unk> area . 
 A <unk> that included <unk> <unk> met senior army officers and told them that the army would not be allowed in until certain demands were met , including the <unk> of the <unk> , the disbandment of the B @-@ <unk> and the abolition of <unk> ( the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland ) . The officers agreed that neither troops nor police would enter the <unk> and <unk> districts . A ' peace corps ' was formed to maintain law and order . When the British Home Secretary , Jim <unk> , visited Northern Ireland and announced his intention to visit the <unk> on 28 August , he was told that he would not be allowed to bring either police or soldiers with him . <unk> agreed . <unk> by members of the Defence Committee , he was " swept along by a <unk> crowd of thousands " up <unk> Street and into <unk> Road , where he " took refuge " in a local house , and later addressed crowds from an upstairs window . In preparation for <unk> 's visit the " Free Derry " wall was painted white and the " You are now entering Free Derry " sign was professionally re @-@ painted in black <unk> . 
 Following <unk> 's visit , some barricades were breached , but the majority remained while the people awaited concrete evidence of reform . Still the army made no move to enter the area . Law and order was maintained by a ' peace corps ' — volunteers organised by the <unk> to patrol the streets and man the barricades . There was very little crime . <unk> , in the words of <unk> <unk> , " as often as not consisted of a stern lecture from <unk> <unk> on the need for solidarity within the area . " In September the barricades were replaced with a white line painted on the road . 
 The Hunt Report on the future of policing in Northern Ireland was presented to the <unk> cabinet in early October . Jim <unk> held talks with the cabinet in Belfast on 10 October , following which the report 's recommendations were accepted and made public . They included the recommendation that the <unk> should be ' ordinarily ' unarmed , and that the B @-@ <unk> should be phased out and replaced by a new force . The new <unk> Chief Constable , Arthur Young , an <unk> , was announced , and travelled to Belfast with <unk> . The same day , <unk> <unk> announced that the <unk> was to be dissolved . On 11 October <unk> and Young visited Free Derry , and on 12 October the first military police entered the <unk> , on foot and unarmed .

 The Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) had been inactive militarily since the end of the Border Campaign in 1962 . It was low in both personnel and equipment — Chief of Staff <unk> <unk> told <unk> <unk> and Paddy Doherty in August 1969 that he " couldn 't defend the <unk> . I haven 't the men nor the guns to do it . " During the 1960s the leadership of the republican movement had moved to the left . Its focus was on class struggle and its aim was to unite the Irish nationalist and unionist working classes in order to overthrow capitalism , both British and Irish . Republican <unk> were formed in Northern Ireland , where <unk> <unk> was proscribed . These clubs were involved in the formation of <unk> in 1967 . In Derry , the James <unk> Republican Club worked closely with Labour Party radicals , with whom they set up the Derry Housing Action Committee and Derry <unk> Action Committee . The Derry Citizens ' Defence Association was formed initially by <unk> , who then invited other nationalists to join . Although there were tensions between the younger leaders like <unk> White and the older , traditional <unk> such as <unk> <unk> , both sides saw the unrest of 1968 @-@ 69 as a chance to advance republican aims , and the two shared the platform at the Easter Rising commemoration in April 1969 . 
 The events of August 1969 in Derry , and more particularly in Belfast where the IRA was unable to prevent loss of life or protect families burned out of their homes , brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the <unk> , and led to a split in December 1969 into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA . Initially , both armies organised for defensive purposes only , although the <unk> were planning towards an offensive campaign . In Derry there was far less hostility between the two organisations than elsewhere and <unk> commonly paid subscriptions to both . When <unk> were arrested after the Official 's Easter parade in March 1970 , Officials and <unk> <unk> their trial together . At the start the Officials attracted most of the younger members . Martin McGuinness , who in August 1969 had helped defend the barricades , initially joined the Officials , but a few months later left to join the <unk> . 
 Relations between the British Army and the residents had steadily decayed since the first appearance of troops in August 1969 . In September , after clashes between nationalist and unionist crowds that led to the death of a Protestant man , William King , the British Army erected a ' peace ring ' to <unk> the nationalist population in the area they had previously controlled . Roads into the city centre were closed at night and people were prevented from walking on certain streets . Although some moderate nationalists accepted this as necessary , there was anger among young people . <unk> between youths and troops became more frequent . The riot following the Officials ' Easter parade in March 1970 marked the first time that the army used ' <unk> squads ' , who rushed into the <unk> wielding <unk> to make arrests . The <unk> squads soon became a common feature of army arrest operations . There was also a belief that they were arresting people at random , sometimes days after the alleged offence , and based on the identification of people that they had seen from a considerable distance . The <unk> were condemned as <unk> by <unk> , who saw the riots as hampering attempts to resolve the situation . The Labour radicals and Official <unk> , still working together , tried to turn the youth away from rioting and create socialist organizations — one such organization was named the Young <unk> Association — but to no <unk> . The <unk> , while <unk> of riots , viewed them as the inevitable consequence of British occupation . This philosophy was more attractive to <unk> , and some of them joined the Provisional IRA . The deaths of two leading <unk> in a premature explosion in June 1970 resulted in young militants becoming more prominent in the organization . Nevertheless , up to July 1971 the Provisional IRA remained numerically small . 
 Two men , <unk> <unk> and Desmond Beattie , were shot dead in separate incidents in the early morning and afternoon of 8 July 1971 . They were the first people to be killed by the British Army in Derry . In both cases the British Army claimed that the men were attacking them with guns or bombs , while <unk> insisted that both were unarmed . The Social Democratic and Labour Party ( <unk> ) , the newly formed party of which John Hume and Ivan Cooper were leading members , withdrew from <unk> in protest , but among residents there was a perception that moderate policies had failed . The result was a surge of support for the IRA . The <unk> held a meeting the following Sunday at which they called on people to " join the IRA " . Following the meeting , people <unk> up to join , and there was large @-@ scale rioting . The British Army post at <unk> 's Lane came under sustained attack , and troops there and around the city came under fire from the IRA . 
 
 = = <unk> and the third Free Derry = = 
 
 The increasing violence in Derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation that <unk> without trial would be introduced in Northern Ireland , and on 9 August 1971 hundreds of <unk> and nationalists were arrested in dawn raids . In Derry , residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests , and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere ; nevertheless leading figures including <unk> <unk> and <unk> White were interned . In response , barricades were erected once again and the third Free Derry came into existence . Unlike its predecessors , this Free Derry was marked by a strong IRA presence , both Official and Provisional . It was defended by armed <unk> — a no @-@ go area , one in which British security forces were unable to operate . 
 Gun attacks on the British Army increased . Six soldiers were wounded in the first day after <unk> , and shortly afterwards a soldier was killed — the first to be killed by either IRA in Derry . The army moved in in force on 18 August to <unk> the barricades . A gun battle ensued in which a young Provisional IRA officer , <unk> <unk> , was killed . A crowd staging a sit @-@ down protest was <unk> down and the protesters , including John Hume and Ivan Cooper , arrested . With barricades re @-@ appearing as quickly as they were removed , the army eventually abandoned their attempt . 
 The Derry <unk> had little contact with the IRA elsewhere . They had few weapons ( about twenty ) which they used mainly for sniping . At the same time , they launched their bombing campaign in Derry . Unlike in Belfast , they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people . <unk> <unk> wrote that " the Derry <unk> , under Martin McGuinness , had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked as if it had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties . " 
 Although both <unk> operated openly , neither was in control of Free Derry . The barricades were manned by unarmed ' <unk> ' . Crime was dealt with by a volunteer force called the Free Derry Police , which was headed by Tony O <unk> , a Derry footballer and Northern Ireland International .

 An anti @-@ <unk> protest organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association ( <unk> ) at <unk> Camp in January 1972 was met with violence from the 1st Battalion , The Parachute Regiment ( 1 <unk> ) . <unk> had organised a march from the <unk> to Derry city centre , in defiance of a ban , on the following Sunday , 30 January 1972 . Both <unk> were asked , and agreed , to suspend operations on that day to ensure the march passed off peacefully . The British Army erected barricades around the Free Derry area to prevent <unk> from reaching the city centre . On the day , march organisers turned the march away from the barriers and up to Free Derry Corner , but some youths proceeded to the barrier at William Street and <unk> soldiers . Troops from 1 <unk> then moved into Free Derry and opened fire , killing thirteen people , all of whom were subsequently found to be unarmed . A fourteenth shooting victim died four months later in June 1972 . Like the killing of <unk> and Beattie the previous year , Bloody Sunday had the effect of hugely increasing recruitment to the IRA , even among people who previously would have been ' <unk> ' . 
 
 = = February - July 1972 = = 
 
 Both the Provisional and Official IRA stepped up attacks after Bloody Sunday , with the tacit support of the residents . Local feelings changed , however , with the killing of Ranger William Best by the Official IRA . Best was a 19 @-@ year @-@ old local man who was home on leave from the British Army at his parents ' house in the <unk> . He was abducted , interrogated and shot . The following day 500 women marched to the Republican Club offices in protest . Nine days later , on 29 May , the Official IRA declared a ceasefire . The Provisional IRA initially stated that they would not follow suit , but after informal approaches to the British Government they announced a ceasefire from 26 June . Martin McGuinness was the Derry representative in a party of senior <unk> who travelled to London for talks with William <unk> , the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland . The talks were not resumed after the ending of the truce following a violent confrontation in Belfast when troops prevented Catholic families from taking over houses in the <unk> estate . 
 Political pressure for the action against the " no @-@ go " areas increased after the events of Bloody Friday in Belfast . A British Army attack was considered inevitable , and the IRA took the decision not to resist it . On 31 July 1972 , Operation <unk> was launched when thousands of British troops , equipped with armoured cars and armoured <unk> ( AVREs ) , dismantled the barricades and occupied the area .

 After Operation <unk> , the British Army controlled the <unk> and <unk> by <unk> large numbers of troops within the area , by conducting large @-@ scale ' search ' operations that were in fact undertaken for purposes of intelligence gathering , and by setting up over a dozen covert observation posts . Over the following years IRA violence in the city was contained to the point where it was possible to believe ' the war was over ' in the area , although there were still frequent street riots . Nationalists — even those who did not support the IRA — remained <unk> opposed to the army and to the state . 
 Many of the residents ' original grievances were addressed with the passing of the Local Government ( Northern Ireland ) Act , 1972 , which <unk> the electoral boundaries and introduced universal adult suffrage based on the single <unk> vote . <unk> were held in May 1973 . Nationalists gained a majority on the council for the first time since 1923 . Since then the area has been extensively redeveloped , with modern housing replacing the old houses and flats . The Free Derry era is commemorated by the Free Derry wall , the murals of the <unk> Artists and the Museum of Free Derry .

 Chad is a <unk> country in Africa whose northern region lies within the eastern reaches of the <unk> Desert and whose southern region lies within the eastern portion of the <unk> . It borders Libya to the south , <unk> to the east , Sudan to the west , and the Central African Republic to the north . Chad was originally part of French West Africa until 1960 , when it declared independence . Some four years later , the former French colony made its <unk> at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo , Japan . For the next three decades , Chad became embroiled in civil war and experienced invasions by Libya and upheavals by Sudanese @-@ backed rebels ; the civil war ended in 1990 , although rebel threats had persisted between then and 2008 . During Chad 's greatest era of instability , athletes from the country did not attend the 1976 Summer Olympics in <unk> , Canada or the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow , USSR , although <unk> were sent to all other games between 1964 and 2008 . 
 The largest <unk> delegation to reach the Olympics appeared in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul , South Korea and at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona , Spain ; each time , Chad 's National Olympic Committee sent six athletes . During the 1992 games , the <unk> sent the nation 's first female Olympian . Since then ( and up to the Beijing games ) , at least one woman has been a part of the <unk> delegation . The smallest <unk> of <unk> <unk> occurred during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , Greece , when only <unk> <unk> competed on the country 's behalf . The delegation that arrived in Beijing consisted of two athletes — one man ( 30 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> <unk> ) and one woman ( 15 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , both participants in track events . <unk> was Chad 's <unk> at the ceremonies . Up to and including the Beijing games , there has yet to have been a <unk> from Chad .

 View of the World from 9th Avenue ( sometimes A <unk> New Yorker 's View of the World , A New Yorker 's View of the World or simply View of the World ) is a 1976 illustration by Saul <unk> that served as the cover of the March 29 , 1976 , edition of The New Yorker . The work presents the view from Manhattan of the rest of the world showing Manhattan as the center of the world . 
 View of the World has been parodied by Ted <unk> , Columbia Pictures , The New Yorker , The Economist and Mad Magazine , among others . The work has been imitated and printed without authorization in a variety of ways . The Columbia parody led to a ruling by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in <unk> v.

The work is regarded as one of the greatest magazine covers of recent generations and is studied by art students around the world .

 Saul <unk> created 85 covers and <unk> internal drawings and illustrations for The New Yorker , including its March 29 , 1976 cover , titled " View of the World from 9th Avenue " . This is regarded as his most famous work . It is considered an example of unintentional fame : <unk> has noted that the type of fame that resulted from the work has diminished his significance to " the man who did that poster " . The work is sometimes referred to as A <unk> New Yorker 's View of the World or A New Yorker 's View of the World because it depicts a map of the world as seen by self @-@ absorbed New Yorkers . At one point The New Yorker applied for a copyright from the United States <unk> Office for the work . It assigned the copyright to <unk> and subsequently reproduced posters of the painting .

 The illustration is split in two parts , with the bottom half of the image showing Manhattan 's 9th Avenue , 10th Avenue , and the Hudson River ( appropriately labeled ) , and the top half depicting the rest of the world . It is a westward view over 10th Avenue . The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a <unk> bounded by North American neighbors Canada and Mexico , with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing " Jersey " , the names of five cities ( Los Angeles ; Washington , D.C. ; Las Vegas ; Kansas City ; and Chicago ) and three states ( Texas , Utah , and Nebraska ) scattered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey , which is in bolder font than the rest of the country beyond the Hudson . Washington , D.C. is depicted as a remote location near Mexico . The Pacific Ocean , slightly wider than the Hudson , separates the United States from three flattened land masses labeled China , Japan and Russia . Notably , the image depicts the world with a back turned to Europe , which is absent from the painting . 
 The work is composed in ink , pencil , colored pencil , and <unk> on paper and measures 28 by 19 inches ( 71 cm × 48 cm ) . When exhibiting this work along with alternate versions and sketches , the University of Pennsylvania summarized the work as a " bird 's @-@ eye view of the city from <unk> Avenue in a straight line westward , with space becoming ever more <unk> ... " They also described the work as a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek view of the world . New York interpreted the New York @-@ centric mind 's view of the rest of the world as a set of outer <unk> as iconic . National Post journalist Robert <unk> described the perspective as one in which the entire world is a suburb of Manhattan .

 View of the World has been imitated without authorization in a variety of ways . The work has been imitated in <unk> format by numerous municipalities , states and nations . <unk> had stated that he could have retired on royalties from the many parodies made of the painting , had they been paid , a motivation for his eventual copyright lawsuit for the Moscow on the Hudson use . <unk> , writing in The National Post , noted that the metaphor of the world as a suburb of Manhattan was " understood and borrowed " by the whole world . Local artists , especially poster artists , presented similarly compelling depictions of their own provincial perceptions . <unk> demonstrated the prominence of this work by mentioning that a high school in suburban Ottawa made imitating View of the World an assignment in its graphic arts class . He also noted that the results of this assignment was a worldwide variety of global <unk> from which the students viewed the world . 
 The illustration — <unk> depicting New Yorkers ' self @-@ image of their place in the world , or perhaps outsiders ' view of New Yorkers ' self @-@ image — inspired many similar works , including the poster for the 1984 film Moscow on the Hudson ; that movie poster led to a lawsuit , <unk> v. Columbia Pictures Industries , Inc . , <unk> F. <unk> . <unk> ( <unk> 1987 ) , which held that Columbia Pictures violated the copyright <unk> held on his work . 
 On June 5 , 2003 , during the first term of George W. Bush 's presidency , Ted <unk> presented A View of the World from Pennsylvania Avenue as a <unk> of View of the World from 9th Avenue in a Universal Press Syndicate editorial cartoon . He replaced the letters representing The New Yorker with The <unk> . 
 The cover was later <unk> by Barry Blitt for the cover of The New Yorker on October 6 , 2008 . The cover featured Sarah Palin looking out of her window seeing only Alaska , with Russia in the far background . 
 The March 21 , 2009 The Economist included a story entitled " How China sees the World " that presents a parody that is also an homage to the original image , but depicting the viewpoint from Beijing 's Chang 'an Avenue instead of Manhattan . A caption above the illustration reads " <unk> by Jon Berkeley ( with <unk> to <unk> and The New Yorker ) " . It accompanied an article that discussed the burgeoning Chinese economy at the time of the contemporary financial crisis . 
 The October 1 , 2012 cover of Mad Magazine <unk> the problems with the September release of Apple Inc . ' s iOS 6 mobile operating system which included Apple Maps , a replacement for Google Maps .

 = = Etymology = = 
 
 During the 16th century , <unk> was named " River de <unk> " by Portuguese <unk> . There are several legends surrounding the name <unk> . During the Brooke dynasty , the indigenous <unk> people practised <unk> to maintain their social status in the community . They threw the heads into the <unk> River , after which the heads had to be collected from the river . The practice of collecting the heads was known as " <unk> <unk> " ( picking heads ) in the local native language . Another story relates that two <unk> warriors named <unk> and <unk> built houses along the river . They and their followers frequently carried out preservation of severed heads near a small river stream branching off from <unk> River because the river bank was flat and wide . Therefore , the small river stream was named " <unk> <unk> " river . <unk> who came to <unk> subsequently pronounced the name as " <unk> " , and later the name evolved into " <unk> " and , finally , " <unk> " .

 James Brooke was appointed the White <unk> of <unk> ( now known as <unk> ) by the <unk> Empire in 1841 . In 1861 , the Sultanate of <unk> ceded the <unk> region to Brooke . <unk> was a small settlement at that time . A wooden fort named Fort <unk> was built in the village , named after Sir Henry <unk> , who was a close friend of the <unk> James and Charles Brooke . Sir Henry <unk> was responsible for crushing the <unk> piracy in the <unk> between 1840 and 1850 . Meanwhile , Charles Brooke was a nephew of James Brooke and would later become the latter 's successor as the second <unk> of <unk> . <unk> <unk> , an Italian botanist , visited <unk> in 1867 . On 4 August , he started his journey on a gunboat named " <unk> " , which was to send $ 6 @,@ 000 to <unk> for concessions being made to James Brooke in the <unk> and <unk> regions . He went to <unk> before coming back to <unk> . He dropped off at <unk> River on 13 August 1867 . His observations of the village were recorded as follows : 
 The fort of <unk> which was built entirely of wood , was in somewhat ruinous condition . It stood nearly on the sea @-@ shore , and just behind it , at a distance of few paces , the <unk> forests commenced ... Some <unk> had settled at the vicinity of the fort and had built a small <unk> ; but the village is chiefly formed by the houses of the <unk> beyond the Chinese <unk> ( village ) . These <unk> used to live further up the river , but since the construction of the fort , and the installation of an officer of the <unk> near the mouth of the river , they came to settle near the sea – a thing they would never have <unk> to do in former days for fear of the attacks of the <unk> pirates and <unk> pirates . 
 The houses of the <unk> people were built in rows on both sides of the <unk> River , mostly furnished by <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Each house had its own shed projection into the entrance of the river , which was used for the processing of <unk> <unk> . On 8 September 1867 , the first <unk> General Council meeting ( now <unk> State Legislative Assembly ) took place here . It was made up of 21 elected local community members ( five British officers and 16 Malay and <unk> local chiefs ) .

 The <unk> Battalion ( Croatian : <unk> <unk> ) was a special forces unit of the Croatian National Guard ( <unk> <unk> garde – <unk> ) and later of the Croatian Army ( <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) established in <unk> on 18 May 1991 , during the Croatian War of Independence . The unit drew personnel from the special police forces and a former French Foreign Legion troops serving as its core . The battalion was set up and initially commanded by Ante <unk> , while Major <unk> <unk> took over as the commanding officer in August . 
 The <unk> Battalion trained volunteer troops in Vukovar in June 1991 before it saw action in <unk> <unk> , the Battle of <unk> and near <unk> in 1991 . By the end of 1991 , the unit 's personnel were tasked with setting up an additional special forces unit of the <unk> . The next year its elements took part in the Battle of <unk> and Operation Tiger aimed at lifting the Siege of Dubrovnik . It also and helped develop and train the Croatian Defence Council ( <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) , setting up a training camp in <unk> . In 1993 , the battalion took part in Operation <unk> .

 = = Background = = 
 
 In 1990 , following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia , ethnic tensions between Croats and Croatian Serbs worsened . The Yugoslav People 's Army ( <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) believed Croatia would use the Croatian Territorial Defence Force 's ( <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) equipment to build its own army and confront the <unk> itself . In order to minimize the expected resistance , the <unk> confiscated the <unk> weapons . On 17 August , the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs . 
 In the beginning of 1991 , Croatia had no regular army . In an effort to bolster its defence , Croatia doubled the size of its police force to about 20 @,@ 000 . The most effective part of the force was the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police that were deployed in 12 battalions , adopting military organisation . In addition there were 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 regionally organised reserve police . The reserve police were set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies , but they lacked weapons needed to arm many of the troops . 
 Preparations to set up the Croatian National Guard ( <unk> <unk> garde – <unk> ) began on 12 April 1991 . Establishment of the <unk> as a police force with military capabilities was thought necessary by the Croatian authorities following armed clashes in <unk> and at <unk> Lakes in March and due to the possibility of further confrontation with the <unk> . The <unk> , formally established on 23 April , was tasked with protection of the constitutional order , maintenance of public order , anti @-@ terrorist operations , protection of Croatia 's borders , territory , coast and territorial waters , as well as the protection of high @-@ value structures and high @-@ profile persons .

 On 18 May 1991 , the <unk> Battalion was established as a special forces unit of the <unk> . The core of the unit consisted of 27 volunteers drawn from the <unk> Special Police Unit ( <unk> ) . Initially , it relied on former French Foreign Legion troops . The most senior among the former <unk> was Ante <unk> , previously a <unk> @-@ <unk> ( non @-@ commissioned officer – <unk> ) in the 4th Foreign Regiment . In consequence , <unk> was tasked with setting up the unit as its initial commander . Major <unk> <unk> , likewise a former French Foreign Legion member , was assigned the battalions deputy commander . The unit was based in the village of <unk> in the region of <unk> <unk> , on the grounds of the former " Josip <unk> Tito " political school . The site , adjacent to the border of Slovenia , was selected to be inaccessible to Yugoslav Air Force raids without violation of <unk> or possibly Austrian airspace . In June 1991 , the <unk> <unk> was transferred to <unk> Peak north of Zagreb leaving <unk> base to the <unk> Battalion , as well as the second special forces unit , the <unk> Battalion . 
 The <unk> Battalion was deployed for the first time on 15 June . It was stationed in Vukovar , tasked with preparation of city defences and organisation of volunteer troops . In August , <unk> took over command of the battalion from <unk> . The same month , the <unk> Battalion was deployed to the <unk> , where it pushed the Croatian Serb forces out of the town of <unk> <unk> . In September , the battalion was deployed to <unk> , where it took part in battle to control <unk> against the <unk> . Troops assigned to the battalion captured <unk> barracks in <unk> . During combat in <unk> , 30 troops of the <unk> Battalion , assisted by <unk> <unk> , captured <unk> Major General <unk> <unk> , along with three armoured personnel carriers ( <unk> ) and 32 soldiers . The unit was deployed to <unk> on 28 October , tasked with <unk> <unk> from the <unk> . After the deployment to <unk> , a part of the unit personnel left to Bosnia and Herzegovina anticipating further conflict there , while the remainder of the unit returned to <unk> . The <unk> was renamed the Croatian Army ( <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) on 3 November 1991 . In late 1991 , personnel of the <unk> Battalion set up another special forces unit of the <unk> — the <unk> <unk> Battalion based in <unk> . 
 In 1992 , elements of the <unk> Battalion took part in the Battle of <unk> , before setting up a training camp in the town of <unk> . There the battalion personnel assisted in setting up and trained the Croatian Defence Council ( <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) . Later that year , elements of the battalion took part in Operation Tiger — aimed at lifting of the Siege of Dubrovnik . In 1993 , elements of the <unk> Battalion took part in Operation <unk> , fighting in the area of <unk> . The Central Intelligence Agency assessed the <unk> Battalion as one of the best units of the <unk> .

 = Temple Beth Israel ( Eugene , Oregon ) = 
 
 Temple Beth Israel ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> ) is a <unk> synagogue located at 1175 East 29th Avenue in Eugene , Oregon . Founded in the early 1930s as a Conservative congregation , Beth Israel was for many decades the only synagogue in Eugene . 
 The congregation initially worshipped in a converted house on West Eighth Street . It constructed its first building on Portland Street in 1952 , and occupied its current <unk> @-@ <unk> facilities in 2008 . 
 In the early 1990s conflict between feminist and traditional members led to the latter leaving Beth Israel , and forming the Orthodox Congregation <unk> Torah . Beth Israel came under attack from neo @-@ Nazi members of the <unk> twice , in 1994 and again in 2002 . In both cases the <unk> were caught and convicted . 
 Services were lay @-@ led for decades . Marcus Simmons was hired as the congregation 's first rabbi in 1959 , but left in 1961 . After a gap of two years , Louis <unk> became rabbi in 1963 , and served until his death in 1976 . He was followed by <unk> <unk> , who served from 1977 to 1994 , and <unk> in turn was succeeded by <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> . Maurice Harris joined <unk> @-@ <unk> as associate rabbi in 2003 , and served until 2011 , when he was succeeded by Boris <unk> . As of 2014 , led by <unk> @-@ <unk> and <unk> , Beth Israel had approximately 400 member households , and was the largest synagogue in Eugene .

 Small numbers of German Jews began settling in Eugene in the late 19th century , but most moved on . In the early 20th century the first Eastern European Jews settled there , and by the 1920s Eugene 's Jewish community began gathering prayer <unk> for holding Friday night and Jewish holiday services in individuals ' homes . Historian Steven Lowenstein writes that " [ a ] <unk> <unk> <unk> 's death in 1933 , his home at 231 West Eighth Street was remodeled and named Temple Beth Israel " . It was a traditional Conservative synagogue , and from that time until the 1990s it was the only synagogue in Eugene . 
 In 1952 , the congregation constructed a one @-@ story synagogue building on an almost 1 acre ( 0 @.@ 40 ha ) property at <unk> Portland Street . Designed by architect and Holocaust @-@ survivor Heinrich <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> , the building featured an interior courtyard that provided natural lighting , and " a network of ceiling beams painted with symbols and shapes " by <unk> . 
 Temple Beth Israel 's services and religious functions were lay @-@ led for decades . Its first rabbi was Marcus Simmons . Originally from England , he was a graduate of University of London and Oxford University , and was ordained at the Hebrew <unk> <unk> . He emigrated to the United States in 1957 , and joined Beth Israel in 1959 . The members were not , however , agreed that a full @-@ time rabbi was required , and in 1961 , he accepted a <unk> position in <unk> , California . 
 Following a hiatus of two years , Louis <unk> was hired as rabbi in 1963 . Born in New York City in 1912 to immigrant parents , he was a graduate of City University of New York and was ordained at the Jewish Institute of New York . He had previously worked for the United Jewish Appeal , and from 1959 to 1963 was the first <unk> rabbi at Syracuse University . There was some concern about <unk> 's hiring , as he had a police record as a result of his involvement in freedom marches in the African @-@ American Civil Rights Movement ( 1955 – 1968 ) . He served until his death in 1976 .

 <unk> <unk> was hired as rabbi in 1977 . <unk> in Reform Judaism , he had previously served as a rabbi in <unk> , Kansas for two years , then lived in Israel for two years , before coming to Eugene . <unk> was known for his support for minority rights and gay rights , anti @-@ nuclear and anti @-@ war activism , support of reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians , and outreach to non @-@ <unk> members of Eugene 's Jewish community . 
 <unk> attempted to revive the Biblical concept of the " <unk> <unk> " in his approach to <unk> . He was willing to <unk> at an <unk> if the non @-@ Jewish partner , after discussions with the rabbi , agreed of his or her own free will to fulfill a set of commitments , including " a commitment to a Jewish home life , participation in Jewish life and tradition , and raising future children as Jews " . The non @-@ Jewish partner making this commitment became a " <unk> <unk> " , or " non @-@ Jewish member of the Jewish people " . 
 <unk> 's wife Alice was a strong feminist , and during the 1980s he and his wife supported a number of changes to the <unk> and ritual . These included allowing women to read from the Torah and lead the prayers , and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - for example , using gender @-@ neutral terms and <unk> for God , and adding references to the Biblical <unk> in prayers like the <unk> , which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical <unk> . While most congregation members approved of these changes , a minority resisted them .

 By the early 1990s serious divisions developed among the members of the congregation over a number of issues , including personal <unk> , the rabbi 's activism and " advocacy of ' ultra @-@ liberal ' causes " , political differences over the Israeli – Palestinian conflict , and 
 a myriad of additional Jewish cultural / religious issues , such as the acceptance of <unk> couples , adherence to <unk> dietary laws , the use of modern language and music during worship services , <unk> of certain prayers such as the <unk> to make them less <unk> , and so on . 
 However , the biggest source of division , which <unk> all others , was " the roles and rights of men and women in the synagogue . " 
 In the early 1990s a group of newly <unk> members began holding more traditional services in a back room of the synagogue , complete with a <unk> , a partition separating men and women . The " more feminist @-@ minded " members strongly objected to having a <unk> anywhere in the Temple Beth Israel building , even if it were not in the services they attended . The latter group eventually circulated a petition which stated that either the <unk> would have to be taken down , or those members who wanted it would have to leave . <unk> also signed the petition . Faced with this opposition , in 1992 the Orthodox members left , renting new premises and hiring their own rabbi , creating Eugene 's second synagogue , originally called " The <unk> <unk> " , and in 1998 renamed " Congregation <unk> Torah " . 
 <unk> held himself responsible , and the schism led to his " <unk> of the needs of Temple Beth Israel and his role as a rabbi " . As a result , he left Beth Israel in 1994 to lead a synagogue on Long Island . During his tenure at Beth Israel , membership rose from 118 to 350 families . <unk> died two years later at age 51 .

 The congregation decided to leave the Conservative movement in 1995 , and for a year had no affiliation . In late 1996 , after considering both Reform and <unk> as <unk> , the congregation affiliated with the <unk> movement . By 1999 , membership had grown to around 370 families . 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> was instrumental in developing the concept of " <unk> <unk> " , the idea that one should only purchase goods that are produced in an ethical way .

 = New York State Route 93 = 
 
 New York State Route 93 ( NY 93 ) is a 43 @.@ 08 @-@ mile ( 69 @.@ 33 km ) state highway in western New York in the United States . The route begins at an intersection with NY <unk> in the village of <unk> and runs in a general northwest – southeast direction across Niagara and Erie counties to its east end at an intersection with NY 5 in the town of Newstead , just south of the village of <unk> . NY 93 serves as a connector between several major <unk> , including NY 104 in <unk> , NY 31 just west of the city of <unk> , and NY 78 south of the city . 
 The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . Although it began in <unk> and ended in Newstead as it does today , the initial routing of NY 93 <unk> from the modern path in the vicinity of the city of <unk> . From <unk> to <unk> 's eastern suburbs , the highway originally used NY 425 , Lower Mountain Road , <unk> Road , and a series of streets in <unk> . NY 93 was moved onto NY 104 and Junction Road in <unk> in the 1940s , and altered to bypass <unk> to the south on a new highway and Robinson and <unk> roads in 1991 . In 2006 , NY 93 was realigned west of <unk> to continue south on Junction Road to NY 31 . The change removed NY 93 from Upper Mountain Road , a county @-@ owned highway that had been part of the route since the 1930s .

 = = = West of <unk> = = = 
 
 NY 93 begins at an intersection with NY <unk> ( Main Street ; co @-@ designated but not signed as County Route 907 or CR 907 ) in the center of the village of <unk> . The route proceeds eastward through the village as a two @-@ lane road named <unk> Street , serving two blocks of commercial areas before <unk> to the northeast and passing into the residential eastern portion of <unk> . At the eastern village limits , NY 93 briefly <unk> to four lanes as it enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Niagara Scenic Parkway . Past the junction , the highway <unk> to a two @-@ lane road and changes names to <unk> – <unk> Road as it runs across the town of Porter . The residential surroundings continue to the hamlet of Towers Corners , where NY 93 connects to NY 18 ( Creek Road ) . 
 After NY 18 , NY 93 curves to the southeast , serving another residential stretch ahead of a junction with <unk> – Wilson Road ( CR 36 ) on the eastern edge of Towers Corners . After this intersection , the homes give way to farms as the road heads into rural areas of the town . The route continues on a southeast track through Porter , passing a mixture of rural and residential areas on its way into the hamlet of Porter Center , where NY 93 enters an intersection with Porter Center Road ( CR 57 ) . Another southeastward stretch brings the route across <unk> Creek and into the hamlet of <unk> , where NY 93 becomes the community 's main street . Through <unk> , NY 93 retains the <unk> – <unk> Road name , intersecting with <unk> Road ( CR 17 ) in the hamlet 's business district . 
 Just outside <unk> , NY 93 leaves the town of Porter for the town of Wilson . It continues generally southeastward across mostly open terrain , meeting Randall Road ( CR 83 ) and Church Street ( CR 56 ) on its way to the town of <unk> . NY 93 becomes North Ridge Road at the town line , and it soon enters the hamlet of North Ridge , a community built up around the route 's intersection with NY 425 ( <unk> – Wilson Road ) . The hamlet 's residential surroundings continue to the adjacent community of <unk> Corners , where NY 93 becomes concurrent with NY 104 ( Ridge Road ) . NY 93 and NY 104 proceed northeast across lightly populated areas for 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) to the hamlet of Warren Corners , at which point NY 93 splits from NY 104 and heads southward along Town Line Road . It immediately intersects with Stone Road ( CR 19 ) before leaving the hamlet . 
 
 = = = <unk> area = = = 
 
 Outside of Warren Corners , the route heads across rural areas along the <unk> – <unk> town line . It soon enters the small hamlet of <unk> Corners , where the road passes under Lower Mountain Road ( CR <unk> ) . <unk> to the highway is made by way of Town Line Road Spur ( CR 114 ) , a connector leading to Lower Mountain Road . NY 93 continues southward along the town line , changing names to Junction Road at an intersection with Upper Mountain Road ( CR 5 ) west of the city of <unk> . From here , the route crosses over <unk> Transportation 's <unk> <unk> rail line at the hamlet of <unk> Junction before intersecting with NY 31 ( Saunders Settlement Road ) and NY 270 ( Campbell Boulevard ) just south of the community . NY 270 begins straight ahead to the south while NY 93 turns northeast onto Saunders Settlement Road , beginning a concurrency with NY 31 . 
 Now fully in the town of <unk> , NY 31 and NY 93 proceed northeast through an open area of the town as a four @-@ lane divided highway . The two routes continue to the western edge of the city of <unk> , where they intersect with Upper Mountain Road and the <unk> Bypass . The overlap ends here as NY 93 turns southeastward onto the two @-@ lane bypass . Along the bypass , NY 93 briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several industrial facilities and intersects with <unk> Road ( CR 903 ) just ahead of a bridge over the Erie Canal . Past the waterway , the bypass takes a more <unk> course through an undeveloped part of the town of <unk> to a junction with Robinson Road ( CR 123 ) on the <unk> – <unk> town line . The <unk> Bypass ends here , leaving NY 93 to turn eastward onto Robinson Road . 
 The route initially serves a line of homes as it heads along Robinson Road ; however , it soon enters a commercial district surrounding the road 's intersection with NY 78 ( Transit Road ) . At this point , the <unk> – <unk> town line turns south to follow NY 78 , leaving NY 93 fully within the town of <unk> as it runs eastward past another stretch of homes . Not far from NY 78 , NY 93 changes names to <unk> Road at an intersection with Beattie Avenue ( CR 14 ) and Raymond Road ( CR 85 ) . The junction also marks a shift in the road 's surroundings as the homes give way to open , rolling terrain . NY 93 continues eastward for several miles to the town of <unk> , where it meets <unk> Road ( CR 35 ) and <unk> Road ( CR 142 ) at adjacent intersections just east of the town line . 
 
 = = = East of <unk> = = = 
 
 NY 93 takes over <unk> Road 's name and right @-@ of @-@ way , continuing eastward past a line of scattered homes to reach the sparsely developed hamlet of <unk> . Here , the route turns southward at a junction with Bunker Hill Road ( CR 136 ) . Outside of <unk> , NY 93 heads southeastward across undeveloped areas of <unk> , connecting to Block Church Road ( CR 110 ) as it approaches <unk> Creek and the Niagara – Erie county line . The road runs along the northern edge of the creek for about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) prior to curving southward at an intersection with <unk> Road ( CR 122 ) . The turn brings NY 93 across <unk> Creek and into the Erie County town of Newstead , where it becomes known as Maple Road and immediately intersects with CR 260 ( <unk> Road ) . 
 Continuing southward , NY 93 runs across open , rolling terrain , meeting CR 259 ( <unk> Creek Road ) on its way to the hamlet of <unk> Mills . Here , the rural surroundings briefly give way to residential areas as NY 93 intersects with CR 255 ( Swift Mills Road ) in the center of the community . South of <unk> Mills , the road serves only intermittent stretches of homes for 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , including a cluster of residences around its closely spaced intersections with CR 253 ( <unk> Road ) and CR 42 ( Rapids Road ) . It continues on a southward track past the eastern terminus of CR 218 ( <unk> Corner – <unk> Road ) to the outskirts of the village of <unk> , where the highway turns east onto Lewis Road and soon enters the village limits . NY 93 runs past a line of homes before intersecting Cedar Street , a road maintained by Erie County as CR 261 north of the village . 
 The route turns south at Cedar Street , following the residential street into downtown <unk> . Here , NY 93 intersects with CR <unk> ( John Street ) at a junction that was once the western terminus of NY 267 . At this intersection , NY 93 heads west on John Street for one block before continuing south on Buffalo Street for another block to Main Street . NY 93 turns westward again , following Main Street through the westernmost part of <unk> 's central business district prior to curving southwestward at a junction with <unk> Street . The highway takes on the <unk> Street name as it crosses over Murder Creek and leaves downtown <unk> . Just south of the creek , NY 93 changes names to <unk> Street at an intersection with Jackson Street . 
 As the route continues southward through the southern part of <unk> , it serves mostly residential areas , save for an industrial complex at NY 93 's intersection with CR 163 ( Clarence Center Road ) and CR 167 ( <unk> Drive ) . NY 93 exits <unk> a short distance south of the junction , at which point the route heads into another area of open fields while retaining the <unk> Street name . It continues on a southward track for about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to a <unk> intersection with NY 5 ( Main Road ) , where <unk> Street and NY 93 both come to an end .

 NY 93 was established as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , connecting the cities and villages of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . While the <unk> of NY 93 have remained the same to this day , several portions of the route have been realigned since that time . When NY 93 was first assigned , it turned south at the hamlet of North Ridge and overlapped with NY 425 along <unk> – Wilson Road to Lower Mountain Road , then part of NY 3 . NY 425 went west from this junction while NY 93 headed eastward , following NY 3 along Lower Mountain , Gothic Hill , Upper Mountain , and Saunders Settlement roads to the city of <unk> . At <unk> Street , NY 93 left NY 3 and exited the city along <unk> , High , and <unk> streets and <unk> Road . It met its current alignment southeast of the city in <unk> . 
 NY 3 was realigned c . 1932 to follow Saunders Settlement Road between <unk> Road ( NY 425 ) and Upper Mountain Road . The former routing of NY 3 along <unk> , Lower Mountain , Gothic Hill , and Upper Mountain roads was redesignated as NY <unk> even though all of NY 3 's former routing was already part of either NY 425 or NY 93 . The NY <unk> designation was eliminated c . 1935 when NY 3 was truncated eastward to a new western terminus in central New York . In the early 1940s , NY 93 was altered to follow North Ridge Road , U.S. Route 104 ( now NY 104 ) , and Junction Road between North Ridge and Lower Mountain Road . 
 Around the same time that NY 93 was rerouted , NY 270 was also extended northward along Junction Road from NY 31 to US 104 . As a result , NY 93 overlapped NY 270 between Lower Mountain Road and US 104 . The overlap with NY 270 remained in place until c . 1963 when NY 270 was truncated southward to the intersection of Lower Mountain and Junction roads . NY 93 was realigned in the late 1970s to bypass Lower Mountain and Gothic Hill Roads on Junction and Upper Mountain roads , replacing NY 270 along Junction Road . The Lower Mountain Road portion of NY 93 's former routing is now maintained by Niagara County as County Route <unk> ( CR <unk> ) .

 The <unk> Bypass , a highway bypassing downtown <unk> to the southwest , was opened to traffic on July 26 , 1991 . The highway cost $ 7 @.@ 7 million ( equivalent to $ 13 @.@ 4 million in 2016 ) to construct and extended from the junction of NY 31 and NY 93 west of the city to Robinson Road south of downtown . NY 93 was realigned to follow the new bypass south to Robinson Road , where it turned east and followed Robinson Road ( CR 123 ) and <unk> Road ( CR 133 ) to <unk> Road in <unk> . The portion of <unk> Road ( NY 93 's former routing ) east of the <unk> city limits became NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route . 
 <unk> and maintenance of Robinson Road from the bypass to NY 78 was transferred from Niagara County to the state of New York on September 1 , 1990 , as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . The portion of NY 93 between NY 78 and <unk> Road became state @-@ maintained on October 1 , 1998 , as part of another swap that also transferred ownership and maintenance of <unk> Road to Niagara County . <unk> Road is now CR 142 . 
 On November 1 , 2005 , the Niagara County Legislature voted on a measure to allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation ( <unk> ) to remove the NY 93 designation from Upper Mountain Road , a county @-@ maintained highway , and <unk> it to Junction Road ( NY 270 ) and Saunders Settlement Road ( NY 31 ) . The <unk> for the change came from a resident of Upper Mountain Road , who demanded that trucks should be removed from the roadway . This part of the agenda was passed . <unk> obliged to the request in 2006 , <unk> NY 93 as proposed and <unk> NY 270 southward to NY 31 .

 = Typhoon <unk> ( 2013 ) = 
 
 Typhoon <unk> , known in the Philippines as Typhoon <unk> , was a typhoon that made landfall in the northern Philippines in late October 2013 . Forming on October 27 near Guam , the storm slowly intensified while moving westward . <unk> developed an eye and became a typhoon before striking Luzon on October 31 . The storm weakened over land , but re @-@ intensified over the South China Sea , reaching peak winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) on November 2 off the southeast coast of China . Typhoon <unk> stalled and encountered unfavorable conditions , resulting in quick weakening . By November 3 , it had weakened to tropical storm status , and was no longer being warned on by the next day . In northern Luzon , <unk> damaged 32 @,@ 000 houses , including 3 @,@ 000 that were destroyed , and caused four fatalities . High winds and rainfall left <unk> million ( PHP , $ 6 @.@ 4 million USD ) in damage . 
 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 
 On October 27 , an area of convection with a broad circulation persisted southeast of Guam , and slowly consolidated due to moderate wind shear and <unk> outflow . That day , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as a tropical depression about 380 km ( 235 mi ) to the southeast of <unk> , Guam . At 2100 UTC on October 28 , the Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) began issuing advisories on the depression , giving it the local name <unk> . The next day , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> ( <unk> ) , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) also classified it as Tropical Depression <unk> . By that time , the storm was moving steadily westward due to the subtropical ridge to the north . With the warm waters of the Philippine Sea , <unk> wind shear , and improving outflow , <unk> gradually strengthened , and the JTWC also upgraded <unk> to tropical storm status on October 30 after an eye feature developed . 
 While approaching northern Luzon on October 29 , <unk> quickly intensified as the initial eye feature organized into a well @-@ defined eye . Late on October 30 , the JTWC upgraded <unk> to typhoon status , and the next day , both PAGASA and JMA followed suit . On October 31 , <unk> made landfall in northeastern Luzon near Cagayan , and developed a <unk> eyewall while initially moving over land . Land interaction weakened the eye by the time <unk> emerged into the South China Sea late on October 31 . The next day , PAGASA discontinued advisories after the typhoon exited the region . <unk> rebuilt around the center , with continued favorable conditions allowing for <unk> . 
 Late on November 1 , a large eye redeveloped , and the JTWC estimated <unk> attained peak 1 minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . Early the next day , the JMA also estimated the typhoon reached peak 10 minute winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . Later , increasing wind shear caused the eye to deteriorate , and <unk> began slowing about 260 km ( 160 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Hong Kong after reaching the western edge of the subtropical ridge . After remaining nearly stationary , <unk> began moving steadily to the west @-@ southwest due to a new ridge . The convection continued to weaken due to continued shear and cooler waters from <unk> , and <unk> deteriorated to tropical storm status on November 3 . The next day , the JTWC issued its final advisory after the circulation became exposed from the convection . Also on November 4 , the JMA downgraded <unk> to tropical depression status off the northeast Vietnam coast . The system dissipated at 0000 UTC on November 5 .

 Before <unk> struck the Philippines , PAGASA issued a number 3 warning signal for portions of northern Luzon , where winds were expected to reach over 100 km / h ( 60 mph ) . The agency noted for the potential for flooding and landslides . High winds knocked down trees across Luzon , and left about 80 % of Cagayan province without power , as well as some areas without internet or <unk> service . <unk> of the Pan @-@ Philippine Highway were blocked , and in Lal @-@ Lo , Cagayan , a car crashed into a gasoline truck due to power outages . Agriculture damage was estimated at <unk> million ( PHP , $ 6 @.@ 3 million USD ) , occurring just before the start of the harvest . Across the island , the typhoon damaged 32 @,@ <unk> houses , including 3 @,@ <unk> that were destroyed , forcing 65 @,@ 648 people to evacuate to storm shelters . Overall , <unk> killed four people in the Philippines , and left <unk> million ( PHP , $ 6 @.@ 4 million USD ) in damage . After the storm , workers quickly restored power lines , while the government provided monetary assistance to storm @-@ ravaged families , after Cagayan was declared a state of <unk> . Members of the Philippine military and Department of Public Works and Highways worked to clean up following the storm . 
 The China National Meteorological Centre issued a " yellow alert " , the second @-@ lowest of the four level warning system , for <unk> due to the threat of the storm . The agency recommended boats to return to port . <unk> in Vietnam also warned for the potential of heavy rainfall due to the dissipating Tropical Depression <unk> , and released water from three dams to prevent overflow .

 <unk> 's Block Ball is a 1995 action video game , a spin @-@ off from the <unk> series for the Game Boy portable console . It is a <unk> clone ; the player controls <unk> along the screen 's edge to knock a bouncing ball , <unk> , into <unk> bricks . The game 's 55 levels include power @-@ ups , bonus rounds , and minigames . <unk> 's Block Ball was developed by HAL Laboratory and Nintendo R & D1 . The team spent half a year revising the gameplay to match <unk> 's signature characteristics . <unk> 's Block Ball was published by Nintendo first in Japan in 1995 , later in Europe , and last in North America in 1996 . 
 Reviewers considered the game an improvement on the <unk> formula and praised its gameplay craftsmanship and incorporation of the <unk> series . It was included in multiple top Game Boy game lists and was later <unk> on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual <unk> . 
 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 
 The player controls <unk> along the screen 's edges to knock a bouncing ball , <unk> , into <unk> bricks . The player loses a life if <unk> hits the edge of the screen . Each of the game 's eleven stages include five rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for <unk> to clear . The ten different block types vary in <unk> and points value . A well @-@ timed hit of the <unk> gives <unk> a powerful bounce to break through harder blocks . Another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round that rewards the player for clearing the screen in the least amount of time . The player can find <unk> stars that lead to minigames , such as air hockey , where the player can earn extra lives . The rounds also include enemies to attack and avoid . Some enemies contain bonus items . Each stage ends in a boss fight . 
 With stone , needle , flame , and spark power @-@ ups , <unk> can transform to interact with blocks differently . For instance , the spark power @-@ up lets <unk> break through otherwise <unk> blocks , and the needle lets <unk> hit spikes once without losing a life . The game has a themed frame and uses a wide palette of colors in @-@ game when played with the Super Game Boy .

 The game was developed by HAL Laboratory with <unk> Yokoi 's Nintendo R & D1 , and published by Nintendo . At one point in development , HAL decided that the game did not feel like a <unk> game . The team spent six months completely revising the game under explicit instructions on how <unk> should move . <unk> games contain elements of unrestricted , creative movement as a general theme . <unk> 's Block Ball was released for the Game Boy first in Japan in 1995 and later in Europe ( 1995 ) and North America ( May 1996 ) .

 = Commonwealth War Graves Commission = 
 
 The Commonwealth War Graves Commission ( <unk> ) is an <unk> organisation of six independent member states whose principal function is to mark , record and maintain the graves and places of commemoration of Commonwealth of Nations military service members who died in the two World Wars . The Commission is also responsible for commemorating Commonwealth civilians who died as a result of enemy action during World War II . The Commission was founded by <unk> Ware and constituted through Royal Charter in 1917 named the Imperial War Graves Commission . The change to the present name took place in 1960 . 
 The Commission , as part of its mandate , is responsible for commemorating all Commonwealth war dead individually and equally . To this end , the war dead are commemorated by name on a <unk> , at an identified site of a burial , or on a memorial . War dead are commemorated uniformly and equally , irrespective of military or civil rank , race or <unk> . 
 The Commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1 @.@ 7 million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153 countries . Since its inception , the Commission has constructed approximately 2 @,@ 500 war <unk> and numerous memorials . The Commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23 @,@ 000 separate burial sites and the maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide . In addition to commemorating Commonwealth military service members , the Commission maintains , under arrangement with applicable governments , over 40 @,@ 000 non @-@ Commonwealth war graves and over 25 @,@ 000 non @-@ war military and civilian graves . The Commission operates through the continued financial support of the member states : United Kingdom , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , India and South Africa . The current President of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is Prince Edward , Duke of Kent .

 = = = World War I = = = 
 
 On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , <unk> Ware , a director of the Rio <unk> Company , found that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio <unk> chairman , Viscount <unk> , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of <unk> <unk> , <unk> @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves <unk> Commission . The new Graves <unk> Commission had over 31 @,@ 000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 and 50 @,@ 000 registered by May 1916 . 
 When municipal <unk> began to <unk> Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further <unk> . Ware began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French <unk> under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not <unk> to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in <unk> , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that <unk> respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages . Similar negotiations were started with the Belgian government . 
 As reports of the grave registration work became public , the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers . By 1917 , 17 @,@ 000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives . In March 1915 , the Commission , with the support of the Red Cross , began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests . The Graves <unk> Commission became the Directorate of Graves <unk> and <unk> in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to <unk> from relatives of those killed . The <unk> 's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war , with units deployed in Greece , Egypt and Mesopotamia . 
 
 = = = Formal establishment = = = 
 
 As the war continued , Ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post @-@ war period . Following a suggestion by the British Army , the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers ' Graves was appointed by the British government in January 1916 , with Edward , Prince of Wales agreeing to serve as president . The National Committee for the Care of Soldiers ' Graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the Directorate of Graves <unk> and <unk> after the war . The government felt that it was more appropriate to <unk> the work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department . By early 1917 a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves . With the help of Edward , Prince of Wales , Ware submitted a memorandum to the Imperial War Conference in 1917 suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted . The suggestion was accepted and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission was established by Royal Charter , with the Prince of Wales serving as president , Secretary of State for War Lord Derby as chairman and Ware as vice @-@ chairman . The Commission 's undertakings began in earnest at the end of the First World War . Once land for <unk> and memorials had been guaranteed , the enormous task of recording the details of the dead could begin . By 1918 , some <unk> @,@ 000 graves had been identified and a further <unk> @,@ 000 casualties were registered as having no known grave . 
 The scale , and associated high number of casualties , of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead . Previous to World War I , individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers . However , the war required <unk> of a significant percentage of the population , either as volunteers or through conscription . An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated , even if they were low @-@ ranking members of the military . A committee under <unk> Kenyon , Director of the British Museum , presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the <unk> . Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions . Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses , it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of <unk> that had developed between serving ranks . 
 An article in The Times on 17 February 1919 by <unk> Kipling carried the Commission 's proposal to a wider audience and described what the graves would look like . The article entitled War Graves : Work of Imperial Commission : Mr. Kipling 's Survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet , Graves of the Fallen . The illustrated booklet was intended to <unk> the impact of Kenyon 's report as it included illustrations of <unk> with mature trees and shrubs ; contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos . There was an immediate public <unk> following the publication of the reports , particularly with regards to the decision to not <unk> the bodies of the dead . The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920 . Sir James <unk> started the debate , followed by speeches by William <unk> @-@ <unk> in favour of the Commission 's principles and Robert Cecil speaking for those <unk> repatriation and opposing <unk> of grave markers . Winston Churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote . <unk> withdrew his motion , allowing the Commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles . 
 
 = = = First <unk> and memorials to the missing = = = 
 
 Three of the most eminent architects of their day , Sir Herbert Baker , Sir Reginald <unk> , and Sir Edwin <unk> were commissioned to design the <unk> and memorials . <unk> Kipling was appointed literary advisor for the language used for memorial inscriptions . 
 In 1920 , the Commission built three experimental <unk> at Le <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , following the principles outlined in the Kenyon report . Of these , the <unk> Communal Cemetery and <unk> was agreed to be the most successful . Having consulted with garden designer Gertrude Jekyll , the architects created a walled cemetery with uniform <unk> in a garden setting , augmented by <unk> 's Cross of <unk> and <unk> ' Stone of Remembrance . After some adjustments , <unk> became the template for the Commission 's building programme . <unk> were required because all three experimental <unk> went over budget . To ensure future <unk> remained within their budget the Commission decided to not build shelters in <unk> that contained less than 200 graves , to not place a Stone of Remembrance in any cemetery with less than 400 graves , and to limit the height of cemetery walls to 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) . 
 At the end of 1919 , the Commission had spent £ 7 @,@ 500 , and this figure rose to £ 250 @,@ 000 in 1920 as construction of <unk> and memorials increased . By 1921 , the Commission had established 1 @,@ 000 <unk> which were ready for <unk> <unk> , and burials . Between 1920 and 1923 , the Commission was shipping 4 @,@ 000 <unk> a week to France . In many cases small <unk> were closed and the graves concentrated in larger ones . By 1927 , when the majority of construction had been completed , over 500 <unk> had been built , with 400 @,@ 000 <unk> , a thousand Crosses of <unk> , and 400 Stones of Remembrance . 
 The Commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave , which amounted to 315 @,@ 000 in France and Belgium alone . The Commission initially decided to build 12 monuments on which to commemorate the missing ; each memorial being located at the site of an important battle along the Western Front . After resistance from the French committee responsible for the <unk> of memorials on French territory , the Commission revised their plan and reduced the number of memorials , and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existing <unk> rather than as separate structures . 
 Reginald <unk> 's <unk> Gate was the first memorial to the missing located in Europe to be completed , and was unveiled on 24 July 1927 . The <unk> Gate ( <unk> ) was found to have insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34 @,@ <unk> names of the missing were instead inscribed on Herbert Baker 's <unk> <unk> Memorial to the Missing . Other memorials followed : the Helles Memorial in Gallipoli designed by John James <unk> ; the <unk> Memorial on the Somme and the <unk> Memorial designed by Edwin <unk> ; and the Basra Memorial in Iraq designed by Edward <unk> Warren . The <unk> and India also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing : the <unk> @-@ <unk> Memorial for the forces of India , the <unk> Memorial by Canada , the <unk> @-@ <unk> Memorial by Australia , the <unk> Wood Memorial by South Africa and the Beaumont @-@ Hamel Memorial by Newfoundland . The programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the <unk> Memorial in 1932 , though the <unk> Memorial would not be finished until 1936 , the <unk> @-@ <unk> Memorial until 1938 and <unk> were still conducting work on the <unk> Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940 . 
 The only memorial created by the Commission that was not in the form of a monument or cemetery was the <unk> Institute at <unk> , Egypt — complete with library , and <unk> and pathology departments — as its memorial to men of the Egyptian Labour Corps and Camel Transport Corps . Its erection was agreed with local political pressure . 
 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 
 From the start of the Second World War in 1939 , the Commission organised grave registration units and , planning ahead based on the experience gained from the First World War , earmarked land for use as <unk> . When the war began turning in favour of the Allies , the Commission was able to begin restoring its First World War <unk> and memorials . It also began the task of commemorating the 600 @,@ 000 Commonwealth casualties from the Second World War . In 1949 , the Commission completed <unk> Canadian War Cemetery , the first of <unk> new <unk> and 36 new memorials . Eventually , over 350 @,@ 000 new <unk> were erected . Many were made from <unk> Wood stone . The wider scale of World War II , coupled with manpower shortages and unrest in some countries , meant that the construction and restoration programmes took much longer . Following the war , the Commission implemented a five @-@ year <unk> renovation programme . The <unk> neglect was largely addressed by 1950 but there were necessary structural repairs to be made . These , together with the <unk> of maintenance tasks from before the war , took a further 10 years to complete and the programme was not completed until the 1960s . 
 With the increased number of civilian casualties compared with the World War I , Winston Churchill agreed to Ware 's proposal that the Commission also maintain a record of Commonwealth civilian war deaths . A supplemental chapter was added to the Imperial War Graves Commission 's charter on 7 February 1941 , <unk> the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the Second World War , which resulted in the creation of the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour . The roll eventually contained the names of nearly 67 @,@ 000 civilians . The Commission and the Dean of Westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in Westminster Abbey but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended . The Commission handed over the first six volumes to the Dean of Westminster on 21 February 1956 ; the final volume was added to the showcase in 1958 . 
 
 = = = Post – World War II = = = 
 
 Following World War II the Commission recognised that the word ' Imperial ' within its name was no longer appropriate . In the spirit of strengthening national and regional feelings the organisation 's name was changed to Commonwealth War Graves Commission in 1960 . 
 More recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible for the Commission to care for <unk> in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether . <unk> Indian Cemetery in Germany was <unk> after the end of World War II and until the German <unk> because it was located in an area occupied by Russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005 . The Six @-@ Day War and War of <unk> resulted in the destruction of Port <unk> Memorial and Aden Memorial , and the death of a Commission <unk> at Suez War Memorial Cemetery . During the Lebanese Civil War two <unk> in Beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt . The maintenance of war graves and memorials in Iraq has remained difficult since Iran – Iraq War in the 1980s , with regular maintenance being impractical since after the Gulf War . 
 The Commission has , and continues to , also provide support for war graves outside its traditional mandate . In 1982 , the British Ministry of Defence requested the Commission 's assistance to design and construct <unk> in the Falkland Islands for those killed during the <unk> War . Although these <unk> are not Commonwealth War Graves Commission <unk> , the Commission manages the administrative responsibilities of these <unk> . Since 2005 , the Commission has carried out similar management duties on behalf of the British Ministry of Defence for <unk> and graves of British and Imperial soldiers who died during the Second Boer War . In 2003 , Veterans Affairs Canada employed the Commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the Canadian Minister of Veterans Affairs has responsibility . As of 2011 , the Commission conducts a twelve @-@ year cyclical inspection programme of Canadian veterans ' markers installed at the expense of the Government of Canada . 
 In 2008 , an <unk> excavation discovered mass graves on the edge of <unk> Wood outside of <unk> . Two @-@ hundred and fifty British and Australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred in the newly constructed <unk> ( <unk> Wood ) Military Cemetery . This was the first new Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in more than 50 years , the last such <unk> having been built after the Second World War .

 The Commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1 @.@ 7 million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153 countries and approximately 67 @,@ 000 civilians who died as a result of enemy action during World War II . Commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a <unk> , at an identified site of a burial , or on a memorial . As a result , the Commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23 @,@ 000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide . The vast majority of burial sites are pre @-@ existing communal or municipal <unk> and parish <unk> located in the United Kingdom , however the Commission has itself constructed approximately 2 @,@ 500 war <unk> worldwide . The Commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave ; the largest of these is the <unk> Memorial . 
 
 = = = <unk> for inclusion = = = 
 
 The Commission only commemorates those who have died during the designated war years , while in Commonwealth military service or of causes attributable to service . The applicable periods of consideration are 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921 for the First World War and 3 September 1939 to 31 December 1947 for the Second World War . The end date for the First World War period is the official end of the war , while for the Second World War the Commission selected a date approximately the same period after <unk> Day as the official end of the First World War was after the 1918 Armistice . 
 <unk> who died as a result of enemy action during the Second World War are commemorated differently from those that died as a result of military service . They are commemorated by name through the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour located in St George 's Chapel in Westminster Abbey . In addition to its mandated duties , the Commission maintains , under arrangement with applicable governments , over 40 @,@ 000 non @-@ Commonwealth war graves and over 25 @,@ 000 non @-@ war military and civilian graves . 
 
 = = = Architects and <unk> = = = 
 
 As well as the main Principal Architects for France and Belgium ( Baker , <unk> and <unk> ) , there were Principal Architects appointed for other regions as well . Sir Robert <unk> was Principal <unk> for Italy , Macedonia and Egypt , while Sir John James <unk> was Principal <unk> for Palestine and Gallipoli , assisted by Thomas Smith <unk> . The Principal <unk> for Mesopotamia was Edward <unk> Warren . 
 As well as these senior architects , there was a team of Assistant Architects who were actually responsible for many of the cemetery and memorial designs . These architects were younger , and many of them had served in the war . The Assistant Architects were : George <unk> Gordon <unk> , <unk> Clement von Berg , Charles Henry Holden ( who in 1920 became a Principal <unk> ) , William Harrison <unk> , William <unk> <unk> , George Hartley Goldsmith , Frank <unk> , Arthur James Scott Hutton , Noel Ackroyd <unk> , and John Reginald <unk> .

 = = = = Common architectural design features = = = = 
 
 Structural design has always played an important part in the Commission 's <unk> . Apart from a few exceptions , due to local geological conditions , the <unk> follow the same design and uniform aesthetic all over the world . This makes the <unk> easily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries . 
 A typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought @-@ iron gate entrance . For <unk> in France and Belgium , a land <unk> near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments . All but the smallest <unk> contain a register with an inventory of the burials , a plan of the plots and rows , and a basic history of the cemetery . The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery . More recently , in larger sites , a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign . The <unk> within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size . 
 The cemetery grounds are , except in drier climates , grass covered with a floral border around the <unk> . There is also an absence of any paving between the <unk> rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace . However , Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and <unk> the nature of the war deaths . 
 
 = = = = Cross of <unk> and Stone of Remembrance = = = = 
 
 Typically , <unk> of more than 40 graves contain a Cross of <unk> designed by architect Reginald <unk> . This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in <unk> in England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic cross . The cross is normally a <unk> four @-@ point limestone Latin cross , mounted on an octagonal base , and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet . A bronze <unk> , blade down , is embedded on the face of the cross . This cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery , intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of self @-@ sacrifice . 
 <unk> with more than 1000 burials typically have a Stone of Remembrance , designed by Edwin <unk> with the inscription " Their Name <unk> for <unk> " . The concept of the Stone of Remembrance stone was developed by <unk> Kipling to commemorate those of all faiths and none respectively . In contrast to the Cross of <unk> , the design for the stone deliberately avoided " shapes associated with particular religions " . The geometry of the structure was based on studies of the <unk> . Each stone is 3 @.@ 5 metres ( 11 ft ) long and 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) high . The shape of the stone has been compared both to that of a sarcophagus and an altar . The feature was designed using the principle of <unk> . The subtle curves in the design , if extended , would form a sphere 1 @,@ <unk> feet 8 inches ( <unk> @.@ 15 m ) in diameter . 
 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 
 Every grave is marked with a <unk> . Each <unk> contains the national emblem or regimental badge , rank , name , unit , date of death and age of each casualty inscribed above an appropriate religious symbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives . The <unk> use a standard upper case <unk> designed by MacDonald Gill . Individual graves are arranged , where possible , in straight rows and marked by uniform <unk> , the vast majority of which are made of Portland stone . The original <unk> dimensions were 76 centimetres ( 30 in ) tall , 38 cm ( 15 in ) wide , and 7 @.@ 6 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) thick . 
 Most <unk> are inscribed with a cross , except for those deceased known to be <unk> or non @-@ Christian . In the case of burials of Victoria Cross or George Cross recipients , the regimental badge is supplemented by the Victoria Cross or George Cross emblem . Sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym because they were too young to serve or were sought by law enforcement ; in such cases their primary name is shown along with the <unk> " served as " . Many <unk> are for unidentified casualties ; they consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body . The <unk> , developed by <unk> Kipling , that appears on the graves of unidentified soldiers for which no details are known is " A Soldier of the Great War known <unk> God " . Some <unk> bear the text " believed to be buried in this cemetery " when they are believed to be buried in the cemetery but the exact location of the grave is not known . In some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one <unk> covers more than one grave . The <unk> does not denote any specific details of the death except for its date , and even then only if it is known , and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death . 
 Due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for the Commission to deviate from its standard design . In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes , such as Thailand and Turkey , stone @-@ faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal <unk> . These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into <unk> ground . In Italy <unk> were carved from <unk> <unk> limestone because it was in more plentiful supply . In <unk> Military Cemetery , in Greece , to avoid risk of earthquake damage , small <unk> are laid flat on the ground . The smaller size of the markers mean that they often lack unit insignia . 
 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 
 Commission <unk> are distinctive in treating <unk> as an integral part of the cemetery design . Originally , the <unk> concept was to create an environment where visitors could experience a sense of peace in a setting , in contrast to traditionally bleak <unk> . <unk> given by Arthur William Hill , the Assistant Director of the Royal <unk> Gardens at <unk> enabled the Commission to develop cemetery layouts and architectural structures that took into account the placement of suitable plant life . <unk> structural and <unk> elements was not unfamiliar to the Commission 's architects . Sir Edwin <unk> furthered his long @-@ standing working relationship with <unk> Gertrude Jekyll , whose devotion to traditional cottage garden plants and <unk> greatly influenced the appearance of the <unk> . Where possible , indigenous plants were utilised to enhance sentimental associations with the gardens of home . 
 Variety in texture , height and timing of floral display were equally important <unk> <unk> . The beds around each <unk> are planted with a mixture of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Low @-@ growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of <unk> , ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from <unk> back during rain . In <unk> where there are pedestal grave markers , dwarf varieties of plants are used instead . 
 The absence of any form of paving between the <unk> rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs . Lawn paths add to the garden <unk> , and are irrigated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain . Where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical , dry <unk> is an ecological alternative favoured by the Commission 's <unk> , as is the case in Iraq . <unk> areas require a different approach not only for <unk> , but also to plants and styles of planting . Similarly , there are separate <unk> <unk> in tropical climates . When many <unk> are concentrated within a limited area , like along the Western Front or Gallipoli peninsula , mobile teams of <unk> operate from a local base . Elsewhere , larger <unk> have their own dedicated staff while small <unk> are usually tended by a single <unk> working part @-@ time .

 Immediately following the First World War , the British Army remained responsible for the <unk> of remains . The Western Front was divided into sectors and <unk> for bodies by 12 @-@ man <unk> units . Between the Armistice and September 1921 , the <unk> units reburied 204 @,@ <unk> bodies . After 1921 , no further widespread search for bodies was undertaken and in February 1921 responsibility of the <unk> was transferred to the Commission . Despite the <unk> searches , bodies continued to be discovered in numbers . In the three years following the conclusion of the general search 38 @,@ 000 bodies were discovered . In the mid 1920s , 20 to 30 bodies were being discovered weekly . 
 The discovery of remains of First and Second World War casualties remains a common occurrence with approximately 30 bodies discovered annually . For example , in 2006 eight bodies of Canadian soldiers from the 78th Battalion ( Winnipeg <unk> ) , <unk> were discovered in a backyard in <unk> , France . In April 2013 , the remains of four British soldiers discovered by a French farmer clearing land with metal detector in 2009 were re @-@ interred at <unk> Cemetery near <unk> , France . In March 2014 , the remains of 20 Commonwealth and 30 German soldiers were discovered in <unk> @-@ le @-@ <unk> , France with the Commonwealth soldiers being subsequently reburied at <unk> British Cemetery . 
 When the remains of a Commonwealth soldier from the First or Second World War is discovered the Commission is notified and a Commission burial officer tries to collect any associated artifacts that may help in identify the remains . The details are then registered and archived at the Commission 's <unk> the collection of evidence can include artifacts with the remains , <unk> data and DNA . The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research . Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties . In December 2013 , it was discovered that Second Lieutenant Philip Frederick <unk> , who was previously commemorated on the <unk> Flying Services Memorial , had in fact been buried in a French military cemetery in <unk> , East @-@ Flanders in Belgium . Sergeant Leonard <unk> was identified in 2013 after a visitor to <unk> British Cemetery discovered a <unk> of an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in France on that date .

 <unk> , including those of war dead , are targets for vandalism . The gravestones , <unk> and buildings of the Commission are no exception . The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the <unk> <unk> by young people , noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays . <unk> thieves will also steal the bronze swords off the Cross of <unk> , which are now replaced with identical ones made in fibreglass . 
 The vandalism of Commission <unk> has also been connected to the participation of Commonwealth countries in contemporary conflicts . In the 1970s , in The Troubles , Commission <unk> in Ireland experienced vandalism . <unk> defaced the central memorial of the <unk> Military Cemetery in northern France with anti @-@ British and anti @-@ American graffiti on 20 March 2003 immediately after the beginning of the Iraq War .

The <unk> deal with such diverse topics as philosophy and charity , the five senses and the alphabet , and a book and a pen . The <unk> are formed in <unk> . The grammar is a reworking of <unk> 's Ars Minor with the addition of information drawn from other <unk> . It was not designed for a newcomer to the Latin language , but is designed for more advanced students . It covers the eight parts of speech through illustrations drawn from classical scholars , although not directly but through other <unk> works . There are also some examples drawn from the <unk> . The work was completed before he became archbishop , and was used not only in England but also on the continent . A recent edition of his works is <unk> Opera <unk> , published in 1968 with some translations into English and German from the original Latin . 
 
 
 = German Type <unk> I submarine = 
 
 The Type <unk> I was a class of small coastal submarines ( U @-@ boats ) built in Germany at the beginning of the First World War . 20 boats were constructed , most of which went into service with the German Imperial Navy . Boats of this design were also operated by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ( <unk> und <unk> Kriegsmarine or <unk> Kriegsmarine ) and the Bulgarian Navy . The group is sometimes known as the <unk> @-@ 1 class after SM <unk> @-@ 1 , the class leader . In the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , it was called the U @-@ 10 class . 
 Built to meet the need for small <unk> submarines able to operate in the narrow , shallow seas off Flanders , the vessels were intended to be quickly constructed , then shipped by rail and assembled at their port of operation . The design effort began in mid @-@ August 1914 and by mid @-@ October the first 15 boats were ordered from two German shipyards . The German Imperial Navy subsequently ordered an additional pair of boats to replace two sold to Austria @-@ Hungary , who ordered a further three boats in April 1915 . A total of 20 <unk> Is were built . Construction of the first boats for Germany began in early November 1914 ; all 20 were completed by October 1915 . Several of the first boats underwent trials in German home waters , but the rest were assembled and tested at either Antwerp or Pola . The German boats operated primarily in the Flanders , Baltic , and Constantinople <unk> . The boats were about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and displaced 127 tonnes ( 125 long tons ) when surfaced and 142 tonnes ( 140 long tons ) while submerged . All had two bow torpedo tubes and two torpedoes , and were equipped with a deck @-@ mounted machine gun . 
 In 1918 four of the surviving German boats were converted into coastal <unk> . Of the seventeen boats in German service , two were sold to Austria @-@ Hungary , one was sold to Bulgaria , and nine were lost during the war . One of the five Austro @-@ Hungarian boats was sunk and another mined and not repaired . The five surviving German boats , the four surviving Austro @-@ Hungarian boats , and the Bulgarian boat were all turned over to the Allies after the end of the war and were broken up .

 In the earliest stages of the First World War the German Army 's rapid advance along the North Sea coast found the German Imperial Navy without submarines suitable to operate in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders . By 18 August 1914 , two weeks after the German invasion of Belgium , the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun . 
 The German Imperial Navy stipulated that the submarines must be <unk> by rail , which imposed a maximum diameter of 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) . The rushed planning effort — which had been assigned the name " Project 34 " — resulted in the Type <unk> I design , created specifically for operation from Flanders . The boats were to be about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and to displace about 125 tonnes ( 123 long tons ) with two bow torpedo tubes . 
 Boats of the Type <unk> I design were built by two manufacturers , Germaniawerft of Kiel and AG <unk> of <unk> , which led to some variations in boats from the two shipyards . The eight Germaniawerft @-@ built boats were slightly longer at 28 @.@ 10 metres ( 92 ft 2 in ) length overall , while the twelve <unk> @-@ built boats came in 22 centimetres ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) shorter than their counterparts . All were 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) abeam and had a draft of 3 @.@ 03 metres ( 9 ft 11 in ) . The boats all displaced 127 tonnes ( 125 long tons ) while surfaced , but differed slightly in displacement submerged . The slightly longer Germaniawerft boats displaced 142 tonnes ( 140 long tons ) while submerged , as they weighed 1 <unk> ( 0 @.@ 98 long tons ) more than the <unk> boats . 
 The <unk> of the boats consisted of a single propeller shaft driven by a <unk> ( Germaniawerft ) or <unk> ( <unk> ) diesel engine on the surface , or a <unk> @-@ <unk> electric motor for underwater travel . The <unk> boats were capable of nearly 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ; 8 @.@ 6 mph ) on the surface and a little more than 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) submerged . The Germaniawerft boats were about 1 knot ( 1 @.@ 9 km / h ; 1 @.@ 2 mph ) slower than their <unk> @-@ made counterparts . The boats were equipped with two 45 @-@ <unk> ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and carried two torpedoes . They were also armed with a single 8 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun affixed to the deck .

 The German Imperial Navy ordered its first fifteen Type <unk> I boats on 15 October 1914 . Eight boats — numbered <unk> @-@ 1 to <unk> @-@ 8 — were ordered from Germaniawerft of Kiel , and seven boats — numbered <unk> @-@ 9 to U @-@ 15 — from AG <unk> of <unk> . After two of the class , <unk> @-@ 1 and <unk> @-@ 15 , were sold in February 1915 to ally Austria @-@ Hungary ( becoming U @-@ 10 and U @-@ 11 in the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ) , the German Imperial Navy ordered <unk> @-@ 16 and <unk> @-@ 17 from <unk> . A further three for Austria @-@ Hungary — U @-@ 15 , U @-@ 16 , and U @-@ 17 — had been ordered from <unk> by April , bringing the total number constructed to 20 . 
 <unk> @-@ 1 and <unk> @-@ 2 were laid down on 1 November 1914 at the Germaniawerft yard at Kiel . <unk> @-@ 1 was launched on 22 January 1915 , just 75 working days later . <unk> @-@ 2 's launch followed on 13 February . Among the <unk> boats , <unk> @-@ 9 was laid down first , on 6 November 1914 , and launched on 6 February 1915 , a week ahead of <unk> @-@ 2 . These first three boats launched underwent trials in home waters , but most of the other members of the class were shipped via rail and underwent trials at their assembly point . 
 The process of shipping the submarines by rail involved breaking the submarines down into what was essentially a knock down kit . Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway <unk> . Type <unk> I boats destined for service with the Flanders Flotilla made a five @-@ day journey to Antwerp for the <unk> to three @-@ week assembly process . After assembly at Antwerp the boats were towed by barge to Bruges for trials . Boats selected for service in the Mediterranean were sent to the Austro @-@ Hungarian port of Pola for assembly . The total time from departure of the <unk> from the shipyard to operational readiness for the boats was about six weeks . 
 By July 1915 all seventeen of the German Imperial Navy Type <unk> Is had been completed . 
 
 = = Service = = 
 
 During their trials the Type <unk> Is were found to be too small and too slow and had a reputation for being <unk> ; one commander compared his Type <unk> I to a " <unk> machine " . According to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice <unk> in their 1931 book The German <unk> War , 1914 – 1918 , the <unk> did not have enough power to chase down <unk> while surfaced and lacked the endurance to spend any extended amount of time underwater , exhausting their batteries after little over an hour 's running . In @-@ service use revealed another problem : with a single propeller shaft / engine combination , if either component failed , the U @-@ boat was almost totally disabled . 
 Another reported problem with the Type <unk> Is was the tendency to break trim after the firing of torpedoes . The boats were equipped with <unk> tanks designed to flood and offset the loss of the C / 06 torpedo 's 1 @,@ 700 @-@ pound ( 770 kg ) weight , but this system did not always function properly ; as a result , when firing from <unk> depth the boat could <unk> after firing or , if too much weight was taken on , <unk> to the depths . When <unk> @-@ 15 torpedoed and sank Italian submarine <unk> in June 1915 , the tank failed to properly compensate , forcing the entire crew to run to the stern to offset the trim imbalance . 
 Despite the problems , the " tin <unk> " , as the Germans referred to them , were in active service from March 1915 through the end of the war , with half of the 20 boats lost during the war . Boats of the class served in three navies : the German Imperial Navy , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , and the Bulgarian Navy . In German service , they served primarily in the Flanders Flotilla , the Baltic Flotilla , and the Constantinople Flotilla .

 The first Type <unk> I to enter service was <unk> @-@ 10 , which formed the nucleus of the Flanders Flotilla , on 27 March 1915 . By the end of April five more Type <unk> I boats had become operational . <unk> @-@ 10 was eventually joined in the Flanders Flotilla by <unk> @-@ 2 , <unk> @-@ 4 , <unk> @-@ 5 , <unk> @-@ 6 , <unk> @-@ 12 , <unk> @-@ 13 , <unk> @-@ 16 , and <unk> @-@ 17 ; of these , only <unk> @-@ 2 made the journey to Flanders by sea rather than rail . 
 <unk> @-@ 4 departed on the first patrol from Flanders on 9 April , and was responsible for sinking the first ship sent down by the flotilla . The Type <unk> I boats of the Flanders Flotilla originally patrolled the area between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , but began patrolling the English Channel after <unk> @-@ 6 pioneered a route past British <unk> nets and mines in the Straits of Dover in late June . 
 Over the Type <unk> Is ' first year of service , <unk> @-@ 4 and <unk> @-@ 13 were both lost , and <unk> @-@ 2 and <unk> @-@ 5 were transferred to the Baltic Flotilla . In March 1917 , <unk> @-@ 6 ran aground in Dutch waters and was interned for the rest of the war , along with her crew . The four remaining Type <unk> Is in Flanders — <unk> @-@ 10 , <unk> @-@ 12 , <unk> @-@ 16 , <unk> @-@ 17 — were all converted to <unk> by 1918 , having their torpedo tubes removed and replaced with chutes to carry up to eight mines . All but <unk> @-@ 10 were lost in 1918 ; <unk> @-@ 10 , in poor repair and out of service , was scuttled in October 1918 when the Germans evacuated from Flanders .

The pair — renamed U @-@ 10 and U @-@ 11 , respectively — were joined by U @-@ 15 , U @-@ 16 , and U @-@ 17 in October .

 = Military history of Gibraltar during World War II = 
 
 The military history of Gibraltar during World War II exemplifies Gibraltar 's position as a British fortress since the early 18th century and as a vital factor in British military strategy , both as a foothold on the continent of Europe , and as a <unk> of British sea power . During World War II , Gibraltar served a vital role in both the Atlantic Theatre and the Mediterranean Theatre , controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean . 
 In addition to its commanding position , Gibraltar provided a strongly defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean . Force H , under the command of Vice @-@ Admiral James <unk> was based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the besieged island of Malta . During the course of the war , Gibraltar came under aerial bombardment from <unk> French aircraft and from aircraft of the Italian Royal Air Force ( Regia <unk> ) based on Sardinia . Additionally , the fortress was the focus of underwater attacks by the Italian Royal Navy ( Regia Marina ) commando <unk> unit ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) and their human torpedoes . This Italian unit was based on the interned Italian ship SS <unk> in the nearby Spanish harbour of <unk> . A number of attacks were also carried out by Spanish and <unk> agents acting on behalf of the German <unk> . 
 Inside the Rock of Gibraltar itself , miles of tunnels were excavated from the limestone . <unk> of rock were blasted out to build an " underground city " . In huge man @-@ made <unk> , barracks , offices , and a fully equipped hospital were constructed , complete with an operating theatre and X @-@ ray equipment . 
 Operation <unk> , the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942 , was coordinated from the " Rock " . General Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was given command of the operation , set up his headquarters in Gibraltar during the planning phases of the operation . Following the successful completion of the North African campaign and the surrender of Italy in 1943 , Gibraltar 's role shifted from a forward operating base to a rear @-@ area supply position . The harbour continued to operate dry docks and supply depots for the convoy routes through the Mediterranean until V @-@ E Day in 1945 . 
 
 = = Prelude and evacuation = = 
 
 World War II dramatically changed the lives of <unk> . The decision to enforce mass evacuation in order to increase the strength of the Rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most <unk> ( some for up to ten years ) had nowhere to call ' home ' . Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being ' British ' by sharing in the war effort . 
 In early June 1940 , about 13 @,@ 500 <unk> were shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco . However , following the capitulation of the French to the German armies later in June 1940 , the new Pro @-@ German French <unk> Government found the presence of <unk> <unk> in Casablanca an embarrassment and sought opportunities for their removal . The opportunity soon arose when 15 British cargo vessels arrived under Commodore <unk> , <unk> 15 @,@ 000 French servicemen who had been rescued from <unk> . Once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked , the ships were interned until they agreed to take away all the <unk> . Although <unk> was unable to obtain permission to clean and <unk> his ships ( and contrary to British Admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of <unk> ) , when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards , he opened up his <unk> for boarding . Just beforehand , the British fleet had destroyed a number of French warships at <unk> el @-@ <unk> in order to prevent them ending up in German hands . The attack , during which 1 @,@ <unk> French sailors died , led to high tensions , which were evident when families were forced at bayonet point by French troops to board taking only what they could carry , leaving many possessions behind . However , when they arrived at Gibraltar , the Governor would not allow them to land , fearing that once the <unk> were back on the Rock , it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time . <unk> gathered in John <unk> Square in the centre of Gibraltar as the news broke , speeches were made and two City <unk> accompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor ( Sir Clive <unk> ) to ask that the <unk> be allowed to land . After receiving instructions from London , a landing was allowed as long as the <unk> returned when other ships arrived to take them away from the Rock , and by 13 July the re @-@ evacuation back to Gibraltar had been completed . 
 British conservative politician Oliver Stanley agreed to accept the <unk> in the United Kingdom , but he argued with Gibraltar over the number of people involved . The Governor , he declared , had given the number of <unk> first as 13 @,@ 000 , then as 14 @,@ 000 and finally as 16 @,@ 000 . He asked for the situation to be clarified , stressing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13 @,@ 000 could be accepted , 2 @,@ 000 of whom were to be sent to the Portuguese Atlantic island of Madeira . The situation , replied General <unk> on 19 July , " is that this is a fortress liable to heavy and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are 22 @,@ 000 . The 13 @,@ 000 was the number sent to Morocco , and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered . " In London the <unk> were placed in the hands of the Ministry of Health , and many were housed in Kensington area . Concern for them in Gibraltar mounted as the air raids against London intensified , coupled with the arrival of <unk> letters , describing the circumstances in which the <unk> were living . 
 In September rumours were already circulating among the <unk> , and in Gibraltar , that the possibility of re @-@ evacuating the <unk> once more was being <unk> , this time the destination being Jamaica , in the West Indies . After much contention , it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island , and 1 @,@ <unk> <unk> left for Jamaica direct , on 9 October , with more following later on . However <unk> followed and the demands were met , partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping . The situation at the end of 1940 , therefore , was that approximately 2 @,@ 000 <unk> were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira , with the bulk of around 10 @,@ 000 housed in the London area .

 Construction of a solid surface runway began in late 1939 and in 1940 it was proposed to extend the existing runway to a length of 1 @,@ 550 yards ( 1 @,@ <unk> m ) . The land <unk> commenced towards the end of 1941 along with the construction of an RAF camp at the " North Front " , now RAF Gibraltar . The RAF dispatched their next squadron to Gibraltar at this time and it was in September 1939 that war with Germany was declared and the strong possibility of German submarines concentrating in the Strait of Gibraltar and using Spanish port facilities , <unk> large in Admiralty thinking . So at 09 : 00 ( UTC ) on the 9 September 1939 , No. 202 Squadron RAF was ordered to Gibraltar , loaded to the <unk> with equipment . 
 On 25 September 1939 , No 200 ( Coastal ) Group was formed as a subordinate formation to HQ RAF Mediterranean in control of No 202 <unk> . The Group 's function was the control of Royal Air Force units operating from Gibraltar . In late 1940 the Group was transferred to Coastal Command . Later a combined HQ was formed which commenced operations in early 1942 . 
 
 = = <unk> French attacks : 1940 = = 
 
 On 18 July 1940 , after the attack on the French Fleet at <unk> @-@ el @-@ <unk> by the British , the <unk> government authorized a bombing raid of Gibraltar as a response . Little damage was reported to have been done . 
 On Tuesday , 24 September , the Italian Stefani news agency reported : " As a reprisal for the bombardment of <unk> yesterday morning , one @-@ hundred @-@ and @-@ twenty French aircraft based in Morocco attacked Gibraltar . " On the same day , the United Press Agency reported : " The French government has issued an official denial of reports , according to which French aircraft were said to have attacked Gibraltar . Up until now , no <unk> have been undertaken . " But the United Press report ended on an ominous note with : " French <unk> are imminent . " 
 Again , on the same day , the <unk> French government issued orders for the naval base and city of Gibraltar to be bombarded . As a result , six bomber squadrons of the <unk> French Air Force ( <unk> de l <unk> de <unk> ) and four squadrons of the <unk> French Navy ( Marine <unk> de <unk> ) were employed in the operation . The 64 bombers flew from bases in <unk> , <unk> ( in Algeria ) , <unk> , <unk> , and Port <unk> ( in Morocco ) . The French action was approved by both the German Armistice Commission and the Italian Armistice Commission . 
 No British aircraft were encountered and much damage was done in the area south of the fortress . The South Mole and a large ship in the harbour were heavily damaged . In the northern part of Gibraltar , fires broke out . 
 On 25 September , the French returned with a larger force of eighty @-@ three bombers to cause additional damage to the naval base and harbour installations . Again , aircraft of the British Royal Air Force made no appearance . However , the French crews did report encountering heavy anti @-@ aircraft fire . One <unk> 451 bomber was lost and 13 other aircraft were lightly damaged during the two days of bombing attacks . The British armed trawler <unk> Stella Sirius was sunk by bombs . 
 The air attack on 25 September was the last by <unk> forces on Gibraltar . 
 
 = = Operation Felix : 1940 – 1941 = = 
 
 The Rock came through the war relatively unscathed but , given its strategic importance , Germany made plans to capture Gibraltar . <unk> " Felix " , the plan which was signed by Adolf Hitler himself was formulated at the highest level of command . With or without permission , Germany would take entry through Spain and attack Gibraltar driving the British out of the Western Mediterranean . The Strait would be effectively closed to the Allies once Gibraltar was in German hands , forcing Asia @-@ bound Allied shipping to steam all the way around Africa rather than to proceed to the east via the shorter route through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal . The Rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving France but landing afterward at Spanish air bases . To deny a possible Spanish capture of the base , the German planners decided that the final attack to seize Gibraltar was to be made by German troops alone . 
 <unk> failure at the highest levels of government prevented the operation from occurring at the beginning of 1941 which had been drawn up in detail by the Wehrmacht in the summer and autumn of 1940 . 
 General Ludwig <unk> 's <unk> Corps would conduct the actual attack on the Rock . The assault forces would comprise the Infantry Regiment <unk> , the <unk> Regiment of the 1st Mountain Division , 26 medium and heavy artillery battalions , three observation battalions , three engineer battalions , two smoke battalions , a detachment of 150 <unk> , and up to 150 miniature remote controlled demolition vehicles ( <unk> ) , packed with high explosives . 
 As part of a combined @-@ force operation , the German Air Force ( Luftwaffe ) would contribute Ju <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , three light AA battalions , and three heavy AA battalions . Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine would cooperate by using U @-@ boats to interfere with British naval movement and <unk> coastal batteries to further discourage the Royal Navy . 
 On 10 March 1941 , with Operation Barbarossa looming , Felix was amended to Operation Felix @-@ Heinrich , whereby German troops would be withdrawn from the USSR to capture Gibraltar . As a result of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco 's <unk> , the operation was postponed , modified , and ultimately abandoned . 
 
 = = Italian bombing of Gibraltar = = 
 
 From Sardinia , Italian <unk> <unk> bombers attacked Gibraltar several times , mainly in 1942 . The last raids on Gibraltar were done during the 1943 Allied landing in Algeria , when those bombers hit successfully even the <unk> port . 
 The only unit of the Regia <unk> ( Royal Air Force ) ever to fly the <unk> <unk> was the " <unk> Long @-@ Range <unk> Squadron " . This unit was formed in May 1941 around the first machines that came off the assembly lines . The training of the crews lasted far longer than anticipated and only in June 1942 the <unk> became operational . The most spectacular raids with the P. 108 bombers were flown in October 1942 when several night attacks against Gibraltar were undertaken from Sardinia . 
 After the armistice of <unk> ( 8 September ) , the German @-@ allied Italian Social Republic launched at least two raids on Gibraltar : one on the night of 4 – 5 June 1944 with ten <unk> aircraft and another on 6 June with nine aircraft . Both sorties were undertaken by the <unk> <unk> " <unk> – <unk> " .

 Known as the " <unk> <unk> Horse of Gibraltar " , <unk> <unk> <unk> , an Italian commando <unk> unit created during the <unk> government , engaged in numerous attacks against the harbour at Gibraltar . 
 Gibraltar was a very tempting target for the Italians , who saw it as a refuge for British warships and allied merchant shipping . The Italian <unk> originally used a Spanish villa ( Villa <unk> ) located two miles ( 3 km ) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named <unk> <unk> . Their base was shifted later to the Italian <unk> SS <unk> , interned in <unk> . 
 
 = = <unk> <unk> from Spain = = 
 
 Lesser known than the Italian actions were the sabotage operations and <unk> @-@ mine attacks carried out by Spanish and <unk> agents recruited in the <unk> de Gibraltar by the Germans . The <unk> contacted a Spanish staff officer from <unk> de Gibraltar , Lieutenant Colonel <unk> <unk> <unk> , a Spanish officer , member of the <unk> and coordinator of the intelligence operations in the <unk> , to establish a network of <unk> with access to Gibraltar . <unk> <unk> designated Emilio <unk> <unk> , also a member of <unk> , as operations chief of the organisation . Most of the recruits for the sabotage operations were Spaniards from the <unk> . A combination of financial reward , ideological commitment and some threats and <unk> were used to gather a significant number of agents . According to the British intelligence , there were at least 183 Spaniards and <unk> involved in the espionage and sabotage operations against Gibraltar . 
 <unk> operations were ordered from Berlin in the late autumn of 1940 , but actual work did not start until early 1941 . The first operations were unsuccessful . A first attempt to smuggle a bomb into Gibraltar was <unk> , as the timing device was faulty . In February there was a large explosion in the North Tunnel , and in April a bomb blew up near the airfield . In June 1941 , however , the British intelligence <unk> a new attempt , by a German agent , to attach a mine alongside an Allied cargo ship . Another attempt failed when <unk> placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive . It was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed . In January 1942 , two Spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the North Front landing strip . 
 <unk> , trained and equipped by the Germans , the <unk> sank the armed trawler <unk> Erin , and destroyed the auxiliary minesweeper <unk> <unk> , which resulted in the deaths of six British <unk> on 18 January 1942 . <unk> was assisted by the Spanish naval commander of <unk> <unk> , Manuel Romero Hume , who allowed him to beach a <unk> there . The British intelligence was able however to counteract the sabotage operations . In March 1942 , a <unk> , José Key , one of the most prominent agents working for the Germans , responsible for the collection of information on military movements for the <unk> was arrested and executed in <unk> Prison in late 1942 . By September 1942 , <unk> , whose activities were closely monitored by the British at that time , resigned and left Carlos <unk> , his second in command , in charge of the operations . In late 1942 , the German headquarters in Berlin ordered the sabotage operations being expanded . In early 1943 , the arrival of an experienced head of <unk> operations in Spain improved the outreach of the operations . 
 In March 1943 an ammunition dump was blown up by <unk> 's agents . The British , growing suspicious of some of the <unk> , banned them from entering Gibraltar . This forced the <unk> to ask <unk> for new personnel . A <unk> working on the Rock , José Martín <unk> , was responsible for the explosion and fire at a large fuel tank at <unk> Island on 30 June 1943 ; this mission , however , would be the first and the last for <unk> , because he was cornered and arrested by British authorities in August , when he tried to smuggle a bomb into a weapons magazine inside <unk> Staff Cave . After being sentenced to death , he was hanged on 11 January 1944 in Gibraltar by British executioner Albert <unk> . A member of an unrelated <unk> sabotage network , Luis López <unk> @-@ <unk> ( also arrested in 1943 ) was executed by <unk> on the same day . <unk> himself was put under arrest by the Spanish police and <unk> . He would be a free man again in December , when he rejoined the <unk> in Madrid , under direct orders of Wolfgang <unk> , <unk> <unk> , head of the sabotage section in Spain . After a <unk> attempt against the life of pro @-@ allied General José Enrique <unk> , <unk> by <unk> <unk> network 's agent Juan José <unk> and a meeting between Anthony Eden and the Spanish ambassador at London , <unk> Fitz @-@ James Stuart , <unk> activities around Gibraltar came to an end . 
 
 = = Operation <unk> : 1941 – 1942 = = 
 
 Operation <unk> was a top @-@ secret British stay @-@ behind <unk> mission that was only to be implemented if Gibraltar was captured by the Axis Powers . Six men were to be sealed in a cave and left with only enough supplies for a year . The volunteers — two doctors , three <unk> and their leader — would run an observation post with one 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) by 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) slit looking over the harbour and a concealed outdoor terrace over the Mediterranean . The team would then wire back all shipping movements to the British Admiralty . 
 They were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be embalmed and cemented into the brick floor . Only if Germany was defeated within their first year would they be released . 
 As the threat of invasion was clearly felt in late 1941 , an idea for a series of secret observation posts ( first in Gibraltar and later in other places like Malta and Aden ) was put together under Operation <unk> . 
 Work in Gibraltar began immediately under Commander Geoffrey <unk> and his chief engineer Colonel Fordham . The site chosen at Lord <unk> 's Battery on the southern tip of the Rock already had an existing <unk> scheme for a shelter . Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of MI6 radio expert Colonel Richard Gambier @-@ Parry . Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task . A member of Scott ’ s ill @-@ <unk> expedition to the Antarctic , George Murray <unk> was called up as Surgeon @-@ Commander to advise on survival techniques . There were practical matters such as diet , exercise , sanitation , and clothing to consider as well as vital " psychology of the personnel " . The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation . A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars . However , Operation <unk> was never needed , as Adolf Hitler turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the Eastern Front . 
 The operation had been <unk> in mystery until the discovery of papers at the Public Record Office in <unk> UK . Previously in the 1960s , details of the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as " Operation Monkey " , yet facts were very sparse . 
 In 1997 " Stay Behind Cave " ( as it was nicknamed ) was discovered in Gibraltar by the Gibraltar <unk> Group , but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission . The discovery came about when the group encountered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel . Further searching led them to break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over 50 years . 
 In November 2006 Jim <unk> and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson , senior tunnel guide with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment , met possibly the only member of Operation <unk> still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home in England . Cooper , 92 at the time , provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a Surgeon @-@ Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve ( <unk> ) . He recalled stories about his colleagues , his training , and his feelings about the task .

 The Mediterranean U @-@ boat Campaign lasted approximately from 21 September 1941 to May 1944 . The Kriegsmarine tried to isolate Gibraltar , Malta , and Suez and disrupt Britain 's trade routes .

From these French colonies , attacks could be launched that would drive Italy out of the war . 
 In July 1942 , Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed Allied Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of Operation <unk> . Churchill placed Gibraltar under the command of General Eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this , the first large @-@ scale Anglo @-@ American operation of the war . He arrived in Gibraltar on 5 November 1942 to take over , not just command of Operation <unk> itself , but also military command of Gibraltar . 
 General Eisenhower stayed at The <unk> , the official Governor 's residence , but his operational headquarters were in a small chamber in a tunnel in the heart of the Rock . In his memoirs General Eisenhower wrote : 
 The subterranean passages under the Rock provided the sole available office space , and in them was located the signal equipment by which we expected to keep in touch with the commanders of the three assault forces . The eternal darkness of the tunnels was here and there partially pierced by <unk> electric bulbs . <unk> , cold air in block @-@ long passages was heavy with stagnation and did not noticeably respond to the <unk> efforts of electric fans . Through the arched ceilings came a constant <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of surface water that faithfully but <unk> <unk> off the seconds of the <unk> , almost <unk> , wait which always occurs between completion of a military plan and the moment action begins . 
 One hundred thousand soldiers on the high seas in a multitude of transports <unk> on Gibraltar . More than 400 aircraft of all types were <unk> into the dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway . Fighters had been shipped in <unk> and assembled on the airfield . Every available area of storage was taken up with ammunition , fuel , and other essential supplies . 168 American pilots were housed in the RAF <unk> at North Front . 
 On 8 November 1942 , <unk> aircraft from Gibraltar landed on captured North African airfields . 
 From their headquarters in Gibraltar , General Eisenhower and Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham directed Operation <unk> , the first major combined combat operation during World War II involving American and British forces .

 Given that Gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it , the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the Rock of Gibraltar . This " town " inside the Rock contained its own power station , water supply , and hospital . Some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end . Two Canadian engineer companies , the only soldiers with diamond @-@ tipped drills and 5 British engineer companies , added some 30 miles ( 48 km ) of such tunnels , a feat thought impossible at the time . That was enough to hold all 30 @,@ 000 troops on the rock . Today , the rock has more underground tunnels than roads .

 On 4 July 1943 , a Liberator bomber from RAF Transport Command took off from Gibraltar for England .

 The aircraft climbed normally from the runway , levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour . The 62 @-@ year @-@ old general died , along with 15 others . The sole survivor was the Czech @-@ born pilot , Eduard <unk> , who was rescued by an RAF launch . The bodies of five passengers and crew , including <unk> 's daughter , were never found . 
 The coffins of General <unk> and his Chief @-@ of @-@ Staff , General <unk> , were draped in the Polish National Flag and lay in state in the Cathedral of St. Mary the <unk> . After a <unk> Mass , the bodies were carried in procession to the <unk> Dockyard with full Military Honours to be shipped to London in anticipation that General <unk> 's remains would one day be returned to a liberated Poland . The route to the dockyard was lined by British troops and the coffins carried and escorted by Polish <unk> .

 In 1943 a British Court of Inquiry investigated the crash of <unk> 's Liberator II <unk> , but was unable to determine the probable cause , finding only that it was an accident and the " aircraft became uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established " . A popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to <unk> aircraft controls . Despite this finding , the political context of the event , coupled with a variety of curious circumstances , immediately gave rise to speculation that <unk> 's death had been no accident , and may in fact have been the direct result of a Soviet , British or even Polish conspiracy .

 The surrender of Italy in September 1943 lifted any possible objections to the return of the <unk> to the Rock . As a result , a <unk> Board was established in November , and at a meeting of the Board on 8 February 1944 repatriation priorities were finally agreed . On 6 April 1944 the first group of 1 @,@ 367 <unk> arrived on the Rock directly from the United Kingdom and on 28 May , the first repatriation party left Madeira , and by the end of 1944 only 520 non @-@ priority <unk> remained on the island .

 <unk> ( Latin : Marcus <unk> <unk> Caesar Augustus ; 8 November , 30 AD – 27 January , 98 AD ) was Roman Emperor from 96 to 98 . <unk> became Emperor at the age of sixty @-@ five , after a lifetime of imperial service under <unk> and the rulers of the <unk> dynasty . Under <unk> , he was a member of the imperial entourage and played a vital part in exposing the <unk> conspiracy of 65 . Later , as a loyalist to the <unk> , he attained <unk> in 71 and 90 during the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> respectively . 
 On 18 September 96 , <unk> was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the <unk> Guard and several of his freedmen . On the same day , <unk> was declared emperor by the Roman Senate . This was the first time the Senate elected a Roman Emperor . As the new ruler of the Roman Empire , he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the <unk> government of <unk> . 
 <unk> 's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army . A revolt by the <unk> Guard in October 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir . After some <unk> <unk> adopted Trajan , a young and popular general , as his successor . After barely fifteen months in office , <unk> died of natural causes on 27 January 98 . Upon his death he was succeeded and deified by Trajan . 
 Although much of his life remains obscure , <unk> was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians . <unk> 's greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death , thus founding the <unk> – <unk> dynasty . 
 
 = = Early career = = 
 
 
 = = = Family = = = 
 
 Marcus <unk> <unk> was born in the village of <unk> , 50 kilometers north of Rome , to the family of Marcus <unk> <unk> , <unk> Consul in 40 , and <unk> <unk> . Ancient sources report the date as either 30 or 35 . He had at least one attested sister , named <unk> , who married Lucius <unk> <unk> <unk> , the brother of the future Emperor <unk> . 
 Like <unk> , the founder of the <unk> dynasty , <unk> was a member of the Italian nobility rather than one of the elite of Rome . Nevertheless , the <unk> were among the most esteemed and prominent political families of the late Republic and early Empire , attaining <unk> in each successive generation . The direct ancestors of <unk> on his father 's side , all named Marcus <unk> <unk> , were associated with imperial circles since the time of Emperor Augustus ( 27 BC – AD 14 ) . 
 His great @-@ grandfather was Consul in 36 BC ( in replacement , and abdicated ) , and Governor of Asia in the same year . His grandfather became Consul <unk> in July of either 21 or 22 , and was known as a personal friend of Emperor <unk> ( AD 14 – 37 ) , accompanying the emperor during his voluntary seclusion on Capri from 23 onwards , dying in 33 . <unk> 's father , finally , attained the <unk> in 40 under emperor <unk> ( 37 – 41 ) . The <unk> were connected with the Julio @-@ <unk> dynasty through the marriage of <unk> <unk> 's brother <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , the great @-@ granddaughter of <unk> . 
 
 = = = Imperial service = = = 
 
 Not much of <unk> 's early life or career is recorded , but it appears he did not pursue the usual administrative or military career . He was <unk> @-@ elect in the year 65 and , like his ancestors , moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist . As an advisor to Emperor <unk> , he successfully helped detect and expose the <unk> conspiracy of 65 . <unk> what his contribution to the investigation was is not known but his services must have been considerable , since they earned him rewards equal to those of <unk> 's guard prefect <unk> . He received <unk> honors — which was usually reserved for military victories — and the right to have his statues placed throughout the palace . 
 According to the contemporary poet Martial , <unk> also held <unk> 's literary abilities in high esteem , <unk> him as the " <unk> of our time " . Another prominent member of <unk> 's entourage was <unk> , an old and respected general who had celebrated military <unk> during the 40s . It appears <unk> befriended <unk> during his time as an imperial advisor , and may have asked him to watch over <unk> 's youngest son <unk> when <unk> departed for the Jewish war in 67 . 
 The suicide of <unk> on 9 June 68 brought the Julio @-@ <unk> dynasty to an end , leading to the chaotic Year of the Four <unk> , which saw the successive rise and fall of the emperors <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , until the accession of <unk> on 21 December 69 . <unk> nothing is known of <unk> 's whereabouts during 69 , but despite the fact that <unk> was his brother @-@ in @-@ law , he appears to have been one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the <unk> . 
 For services unknown , he was rewarded with a <unk> early in <unk> 's reign in 71 . This was a remarkable honour , not only because he held this office early under the new regime , but also because it was an ordinary <unk> ( instead of a less prestigious <unk> <unk> ) , making him one of the few non @-@ <unk> to be honoured in this way under <unk> . After 71 <unk> again disappears from historical record , presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under <unk> ( 69 – 79 ) and his sons Titus ( 79 – 81 ) and <unk> ( 81 – 96 ) . 
 He re @-@ emerges during the revolt of <unk> in 89 . On 1 January , 89 , the governor of <unk> Superior , Lucius Antonius <unk> , and his two <unk> at <unk> , <unk> XIV <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> against the Roman Empire with the aid of a tribe of the <unk> . The governor of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , moved to the region at once , assisted by the <unk> of <unk> , Titus <unk> <unk> . Within twenty @-@ four days the rebellion was crushed , and its leaders at <unk> <unk> punished . The <unk> <unk> were sent to the front of <unk> , while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded . 
 <unk> opened the year following the revolt by sharing the <unk> with <unk> . Again , the honour suggested <unk> had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy , perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the <unk> conspiracy under <unk> . Alternatively , <unk> may have selected <unk> as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status @-@ <unk> of the regime . The revolt had been suppressed , and the Empire could return to order .

 On 18 September , 96 , <unk> was assassinated in a palace conspiracy organised by court officials . The <unk> <unk> , the <unk> Calendar , records that the same day the Senate proclaimed Marcus <unk> <unk> emperor . Despite his political experience , this was a remarkable choice . <unk> was old and <unk> , and had spent much of his career out of the public light , prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in <unk> 's assassination . 
 According to <unk> <unk> , the conspirators approached <unk> as a potential successor prior to the assassination , which indicates that he was at least aware of the plot . <unk> by contrast does not mention <unk> , but he may have omitted his role out of <unk> . Considering the works of <unk> were published under <unk> 's direct descendants Trajan and <unk> , it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder . On the other hand , <unk> lacked widespread support in the Empire , and as a known <unk> loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators . The precise facts have been obscured by history , but modern historians believe <unk> was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate , within hours after the news of the assassination broke . 
 Although he appeared to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health , <unk> was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and <unk> . Furthermore , he had close connections with the <unk> dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate . <unk> had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of <unk> ; he knew that to <unk> even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict . Rather than decline the invitation and risk <unk> , he accepted . The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war , but neither the Senate nor <unk> appears to have been involved in the conspiracy against <unk> . 
 Following the accession of <unk> as emperor , the Senate passed <unk> <unk> on <unk> : his coins and statues were melted , his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records . In many instances , existing portraits of <unk> , such as those found on the <unk> <unk> , were simply <unk> to fit the likeness of <unk> . This allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material . In addition , the vast palace which <unk> had erected on the <unk> Hill , known as the <unk> Palace , was renamed the " House of the People " , and <unk> himself took up residence in <unk> 's former villa in the Gardens of <unk> . 
 
 = = = Administration = = = 
 
 The change of government was welcome particularly to the <unk> , who had been harshly persecuted during <unk> 's reign . As an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters , <unk> publicly <unk> that no <unk> would be put to death as long as he remained in office . He called an end to trials based on treason , released those who had been imprisoned under these charges , and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled . 
 All properties which had been confiscated by <unk> were returned to their respective families . <unk> also sought to involve the Senate in his government , but this was not entirely successful . He continued to rely largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted , and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro @-@ <unk> faction of the Senate , he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life . 
 Having been proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate , <unk> had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the Roman populace . As was custom by this time , a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment of gifts and money to the people and the army . Accordingly , a <unk> of 75 <unk> per head was bestowed upon the citizens , while the soldiers of the <unk> Guard received a <unk> which may have amounted to as much as 5000 <unk> per person . This was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most <unk> Romans . 
 To the poorest , <unk> granted <unk> of land worth up to 60 million <unk> . He <unk> parents and their children from a 5 % inheritance tax , and he made loans to Italian landowners on the condition that they pay interest of 5 % to their municipality to support the children of <unk> families ; <unk> schemes which were later expanded by Trajan , <unk> Pius , and Marcus Aurelius . Furthermore , numerous taxes were <unk> and privileges granted to Roman provinces . <unk> , he probably abolished the <unk> <unk> , the additional tax which all Jews throughout the Empire had to pay : some of his coins bear the legend <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( abolition of malicious prosecution regarding the Jewish tax ) . 
 Before long , <unk> 's expenses strained the economy of Rome and , although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by <unk> , necessitated the formation of a special commission of economy to drastically reduce <unk> . The most superfluous religious sacrifices , games and horse races were abolished , while new income was generated from <unk> 's former possessions , including the <unk> of ships , estates , and even furniture . Large amounts of money were obtained from <unk> 's silver and gold statues , and <unk> forbade that similar images be made in his honor . 
 Because he reigned only briefly , <unk> 's public works were few , instead completing projects which had been initiated under <unk> rule . This included extensive repairs to the Roman road system and the expansion of the <unk> . The latter program was headed by the former consul <unk> Julius <unk> , who helped to put an end to abuses and later published a significant work on Rome 's water supply , De <unk> <unk> <unk> . The only major landmarks constructed under <unk> were a <unk> , known as the <unk> <unk> , and a small Imperial <unk> begun by <unk> , which linked the <unk> of Augustus to the Temple of Peace . Little remains , partly because the Via <unk> <unk> <unk> cuts across it .

 Despite <unk> 's measures to remain popular with the Senate and the Roman people , support for <unk> remained strong in the army , which had called for his <unk> immediately after the assassination . In an attempt to appease the soldiers of the <unk> Guard , <unk> had dismissed their prefect Titus <unk> <unk> — one of the chief conspirators against <unk> — and replaced him with a former commander , <unk> <unk> . 
 Likewise , the generous <unk> bestowed upon the soldiers following his accession was expected to swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change . The <unk> considered these measures insufficient , however , and demanded the execution of <unk> 's assassins , which <unk> refused . Continued dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would ultimately lead to the <unk> crisis of <unk> 's reign . 
 While the swift transfer of power following <unk> 's death had prevented a civil war from <unk> , <unk> 's position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable , and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority . Upon his accession , he had ordered a halt to treason trials , but at the same time allowed the prosecution of <unk> by the Senate to continue . This measure led to chaos , as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies , leading the consul <unk> to famously remark that <unk> 's <unk> was ultimately <unk> to <unk> 's anarchy . Early in 97 , a conspiracy led by the senator <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> failed , but once again <unk> refused to put the conspirators to death , much to the disapproval of the Senate . 
 The situation was further aggravated by the absence of a clear successor , made more pressing because of <unk> 's old age and sickness . He had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives , who were unsuited for political office . A successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the Empire and it appears that , by 97 , <unk> was considering to adopt Marcus Cornelius <unk> <unk> <unk> , the powerful governor of Syria . This was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander Marcus <unk> <unk> , commonly known as Trajan , a general of the armies at the German frontier . 
 In October 97 these tensions came to a head when the <unk> Guard , led by <unk> <unk> , laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took <unk> hostage . He was forced to submit to their demands , agreeing to hand over those responsible for <unk> 's death and even giving a speech <unk> the rebellious <unk> . Titus <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> 's former <unk> , were sought out and killed . <unk> was unharmed in this assault , but his authority was damaged beyond repair . 
 He realized that his position was no longer <unk> without the support of an heir who had the approval of both the army and the people . Shortly thereafter , he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor , and with this decision all but abdicated . Trajan was formally bestowed with the title of Caesar and shared the <unk> with <unk> in 98 : 
 Contrary to the view here popularized by <unk> <unk> , however , <unk> had in fact little choice with regard to his successor . Faced with a major crisis , he desperately needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged reputation . The only candidate with sufficient military experience , <unk> ancestry , and connections was Trajan . Likewise , Edward <unk> 's assertion that <unk> <unk> established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good <unk> has found little support among modern historians . 
 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 
 On 1 January , 98 , at the start of his fourth <unk> , <unk> suffered a stroke during a private audience . Shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the Gardens of <unk> , on 28 January . He was deified by the Senate , and his ashes were laid to rest in the <unk> of Augustus . 
 <unk> was succeeded without incident by his adopted son Trajan , who was greeted by the Roman populace with much enthusiasm . According to Pliny the Younger , Trajan dedicated a temple in honour of <unk> , yet no trace of it has ever been found ; nor was a commemorative series of coins for the <unk> <unk> issued until ten years after his death . According to <unk> <unk> , however , the Guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against <unk> , <unk> <unk> , was ' dismissed ' upon Trajan 's accession . 
 Due to the lack of written sources on this period , much of <unk> 's life has remained obscure . The most substantial surviving account of the reign of <unk> was written by the 3rd @-@ century historian <unk> <unk> . His Roman History , which spans nearly a millennium , from the arrival of <unk> in Italy until the year <unk> , was composed more than one hundred years after <unk> had died . Further details are added by an abridged biography from the <unk> de <unk> , a work alleged to have been authored by the 4th @-@ century historian Aurelius Victor . 
 A more comprehensive text , presumed to describe the life of <unk> in closer detail , is the <unk> , by the contemporary historian <unk> . The <unk> is an account of the history of Rome covering three decades from the suicide of emperor <unk> in 69 until the death of <unk> in 96 . Unfortunately , a substantial part of the work has been lost , with only the first five books covering the Year of the Four <unk> remaining . In the introduction to his biography of <unk> Julius <unk> however , <unk> speaks highly of <unk> , describing his reign as " the dawn of a most happy age , [ when ] <unk> Caesar blended things once <unk> , sovereignty and freedom " . 
 The surviving histories speak equally positively of <unk> 's brief reign , although none offer a substantial commentary on his policies . Both <unk> <unk> and Aurelius Victor emphasize his wisdom and <unk> , with <unk> commending his decision to adopt Trajan as his heir . These views were later popularized by the 18th @-@ century historian Edward <unk> in his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . <unk> considered <unk> the first of the Five Good <unk> , five successive rulers under whom the Roman Empire " was governed by absolute power , under the guidance of wisdom and virtue " from 96 until 180 . Nevertheless , even <unk> notes that , compared to his successors , <unk> may have lacked the necessary qualifications for a successful reign : 
 Modern history has expanded upon this sentiment , characterizing <unk> as a well @-@ <unk> but weak and <unk> ruler . The Roman Senate enjoyed renewed liberties under his rule , but <unk> 's <unk> of the state finances and lack of authority over the army ultimately brought Rome near the edge of a significant crisis . The mutiny led by <unk> <unk> was never intended as a coup , but a calculated attempt to put pressure on the emperor . The adoption of Trajan expanded his power base with a respected , reliable general as his successor . <unk> concludes that <unk> 's real talents were in fact ill @-@ suited to the <unk> : 
 His place in Roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary , if tumultuous stop @-@ gap before the <unk> @-@ <unk> dynasties . It is a fact of irony that even the only major public work completed during his reign , the <unk> of <unk> , ultimately became known as the <unk> <unk> , or transitional forum . 
 Two modern statues which commemorate <unk> can be found in towns associated with him . There is an <unk> statue in Gloucester , England , a town which was founded in his honour . It is at the entrance to <unk> Street . There is also a statue at his alleged birthplace , <unk> in Italy , at <unk> <unk> street .

 The <unk> is a 1961 American drama film directed by Robert <unk> from Walter <unk> 's 1959 novel of the same name , adapted for the screen by <unk> and Sidney Carroll . It tells the story of small @-@ time pool <unk> " Fast Eddie " <unk> and his desire to break into the " major league " of professional <unk> and high @-@ stakes <unk> by high @-@ <unk> that follows it .

Eddie dismisses Charlie as a scared old man and tells him to " go lie down and die " by himself . 
 At Johnny 's Bar , Eddie joins a poker game where Bert is playing , and loses $ 20 . Afterward , Bert tells Eddie that he has talent as a pool player but no character .

 The <unk> novel had been optioned several times , including by Frank Sinatra , but attempts to adapt it for the screen were unsuccessful . Director <unk> 's daughter Carol <unk> speculates that previous adaptations focused too much on the pool aspects of the story and not enough on the human interaction . <unk> , who had <unk> pool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a pool @-@ themed play called Corner Pocket , optioned the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script . 
 According to Bobby <unk> 's agent , Martin Baum , Paul Newman 's agent turned down the part of Fast Eddie . Newman was originally unavailable to play Fast Eddie regardless , being committed to star opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the film Two for the <unk> . <unk> offered <unk> the part after seeing him on The Mike Wallace Interview . When Taylor was forced to drop out of <unk> because of shooting <unk> on Cleopatra , Newman was freed up to take the role , which he accepted after reading just half of the script . No one associated with the production officially notified <unk> or his representatives that he had been replaced ; they found out from a member of the public at a charity horse race . 
 <unk> filmed The <unk> over six weeks , entirely in New York City . Much of the action was filmed at two now @-@ defunct pool halls , <unk> 's and Ames <unk> Academy . Other shooting locations included a <unk> on East 82nd Street , which served as the Louisville home of Murray Hamilton 's character <unk> , and the Manhattan <unk> bus terminal . The film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders . Willie <unk> served as technical advisor on the film and shot a number of the trick shots in place of the actors . All of Gleason 's shots were his own ; they were filmed in wide @-@ angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames . <unk> , in pursuit of the style he termed " neo @-@ neo @-@ realistic " , hired actual street thugs , enrolled them in the Screen Actors Guild and used them as extras . Scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at Ames pool hall establishing that Eddie is on his way to town ( originally slated to be the first scene of the film ) and a longer scene of Preacher talking to Bert at Johnny 's Bar which establishes Preacher is a <unk> . 
 Early shooting put more focus on the pool playing , but during filming <unk> made the decision to place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie 's characters . Despite the change in emphasis , <unk> still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie 's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah , through the positioning of the characters in the frame . For example , when Eddie is playing <unk> , Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above <unk> while still below Bert in a three shot . When Sarah enters the room , she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert . When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah 's body , Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert , ending up on top of him . Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat <unk> .

 The <unk> is fundamentally a story of what it means to be a human being , <unk> within the context of winning and losing . Describing the film , Robert <unk> said : " My protagonist , Fast Eddie , wants to become a great pool player , but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being . He <unk> self @-@ awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused — and then he wins his pool game . " Roger <unk> <unk> with this assessment , citing The <unk> as " one of the few American movies in which the hero wins by surrendering , by accepting reality instead of his dreams . " 
 The film was also somewhat autobiographical for <unk> , relating to his dealings with the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee . A screenwriter during the 1930s and ' 40s , he had been involved with the Communist Party in the 1930s and refused to name names at his first <unk> appearance . Ultimately he changed his mind and identified friends and colleagues as party members . Similarly , <unk> sells his soul and betrays the one person who really knows and loves him in a <unk> pact to gain character . 
 Film and theatre historian <unk> <unk> has identified The <unk> as one of a handful of films from the early 1960s that re @-@ defined the relationship of films to their audiences . This new relationship , he writes , is " one of challenge rather than <unk> , of doubt rather than certainty . " No film of the 1950s , <unk> asserts , " took such a brutal , clear look at the ego @-@ affirmation of the one @-@ on @-@ one contest , at the <unk> of the winner or the <unk> vulnerability of the loser . " Although some have suggested the resemblance of this film to classic film noir , <unk> rejects the comparison based on <unk> 's ultra @-@ realistic style , also noting that the film lacks noir 's " <unk> Woman or its <unk> in discovering crime among the <unk> , hungry bank clerks and <unk> wives . " <unk> does note that while Fast Eddie " has a slight fifties ring " , the character " makes a decisive break with the extraordinarily feeling tough guys of the ' rebel ' era ... [ b ] <unk> he does end up seeking out his emotions " and telling Bert that he is a loser because he 's dead inside .

 The <unk> had its world premiere in Washington , D.C. on September 25 , 1961 . Prior to the premiere , Richard Burton hosted a midnight screening of the film for the casts of the season 's Broadway shows , which generated a great deal of positive word of mouth . Initially reluctant to publicize the film , 20th Century Fox responded by stepping up its promotional activities . 
 The film was well received by critics , although with the occasional <unk> . Variety praised the performances of the entire main cast but felt that the " <unk> aspects " of the story prevented the film from achieving the " goal of being pure entertainment . " Variety also felt the film was far too long . Stanley <unk> , writing for The New Republic , concurred in part with this assessment . <unk> strongly praised the principal cast , calling Newman " first @-@ rate " and writing that Scott 's was " his most credible performance to date . " Laurie , he writes , gives her part " <unk> <unk> touches " ( although he also <unk> criticizes her for over @-@ reliance on Method acting ) . While he found that the script " strains hard to give an air of menace and <unk> to the pool hall " and also declares it " full of pseudo @-@ meaning " , <unk> <unk> <unk> 's " sure , economical " direction , especially in regard to Gleason who , he says , does not so much act as " [ pose ] for a number of pictures which are well arranged by <unk> . It is the best use of a <unk> by a director since <unk> photographed <unk> <unk> as Big Daddy . " The New York Times , despite finding that the film " <unk> a bit " and that the romance between Newman and Laurie 's characters " seems a <unk> far @-@ <unk> " , nonetheless found that The <unk> " speaks powerfully in a universal language that <unk> and reveals bitter truths . " 
 The <unk> received nine Academy Award nominations . The film won two , for Best Art Direction @-@ Set Decoration , Black @-@ and @-@ White ( Harry Horner and Gene <unk> ) and Best <unk> , Black @-@ and @-@ White ( <unk> <unk> ) . The film was also nominated for Best Picture and Newman was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role . Gleason and Scott were both nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role ; Scott refused the nomination . Laurie was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role . <unk> received nominations for Best Director and , with Carroll , for Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another <unk> .

 In the decades since its release , The <unk> has cemented its reputation as a classic . Roger <unk> , echoing earlier praise for the performances , direction , and cinematography and adding <unk> for editor <unk> Allen , cites the film as " one of those films where scenes have such psychic weight that they grow in our memories . " He further cites Fast Eddie <unk> as one of " only a handful of movie characters so real that the audience refers to them as <unk> . " TV Guide calls the film a " dark <unk> " offering " a <unk> world whose only bright spot is the top of the pool table , yet [ with ] characters [ who ] maintain a <unk> nobility and grace . " The four leads are again lavishly praised for their performances and the film is summed up as " not to be missed . " 
 Paul Newman reprised his role as Fast Eddie <unk> in the 1986 film The Color of Money , for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role . A number of observers and critics have suggested that this Oscar was in <unk> recognition for his performance in The <unk> . In 1997 , the Library of Congress selected The <unk> for preservation in the United States National Film <unk> as " culturally , historically , or <unk> significant . " Carroll and <unk> 's screenplay was selected by the Writers Guild of America in 2006 as the <unk> best motion picture screenplay of all time . In June 2008 , <unk> released its " Ten top Ten " — the best ten films in ten " classic " American film genres — after polling over 1 @,@ 500 people from the creative community . The <unk> was acknowledged as the sixth best film in the sports genre . 
 The <unk> is credited with sparking a resurgence in the popularity of pool in the United States , which had been on the decline for decades . The film also brought recognition to Willie <unk> , who , despite having won multiple world championships , was virtually unknown to the general public . Perhaps the greatest <unk> of the film 's popularity was a real @-@ life pool <unk> named Rudolf <unk> . <unk> claimed in an interview at the time of the film 's release that the character of Minnesota <unk> was based on <unk> , who at the time was known as " New York <unk> " . <unk> immediately adopted the Minnesota <unk> nickname and <unk> his association with the film into book and television deals and other ventures . Author Walter <unk> denied for the rest of his life that <unk> had played any role in the creation of the character . Other players would claim , with greater or lesser degrees of credibility , to have served as models for Fast Eddie , including Ronnie Allen , Ed Taylor , Ed Parker , and Eddie <unk> .
