 Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of <unk> lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea . It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus . It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming " lobster red " on cooking . Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into <unk> larvae . Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles .

 Homarus gammarus is a large <unk> , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 9 lb ) . Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard <unk> which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called <unk> ( <unk> ) . This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals . 
 The first pair of <unk> is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . The larger one is the " <unk> " , and has rounded <unk> used for crushing prey ; the other is the " cutter " , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . Usually , the left claw is the <unk> , and the right is the cutter . 
 The <unk> is generally blue above , with spots that <unk> , and yellow below . The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . This occurs because , in life , the red pigment <unk> is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment . 
 The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus . The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics : 
 The <unk> of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in H. gammarus . 
 The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red @-@ tipped , while those of H. gammarus are white or white @-@ tipped . 
 The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red , while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red . 
 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 
 Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size . Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently <unk> female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male . The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her <unk> . Females carrying eggs are said to be " <unk> " and can be found throughout the year . 
 The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on <unk> . This stage involves three <unk> and lasts for 15 – 35 days . After the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a <unk> lifestyle . The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the <unk> phase . When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives . 
 
 = = Distribution = = 
 
 Homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco , not including the Baltic Sea . It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only missing from the section east of Crete , and along only the north @-@ west coast of the Black Sea . The <unk> populations are found in the Norwegian <unk> <unk> and <unk> , inside the Arctic Circle . 
 The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment . The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been referred to as the " midnight @-@ sun lobster " . The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean . The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the <unk> were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel . 
 Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand , alongside other European species such as the edible crab , Cancer <unk> . Between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from <unk> in <unk> , but the species did not become established there . 
 
 = = Ecology = = 
 
 Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – <unk> ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . They prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed . 
 The diet of H. gammarus mostly consists of other <unk> invertebrates . These include crabs , molluscs , sea <unk> , <unk> and polychaete worms . 
 The three <unk> lobster species Homarus gammarus , H. americanus and <unk> <unk> are hosts to the three known species of the animal <unk> <unk> ; the species on H. gammarus has not been described . 
 Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease <unk> , caused by the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Although it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out .

 Homarus gammarus is traditionally " highly esteemed " as a <unk> and was mentioned in " The <unk> " a seventeenth century English folk song . It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered . Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain " excellent " white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible . The exceptions are the <unk> mill and the " sand vein " ( gut ) . The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better flavour . 
 <unk> are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines <unk> with <unk> or <unk> sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand . In 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands ) . The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) . 
 <unk> systems for H. gammarus are under development , and production rates are still very low .

 Homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema <unk> , published in 1758 . That name was Cancer gammarus , since Linnaeus ' concept of the genus Cancer at that time included all large crustaceans . 
 H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature . Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including <unk> <unk> <unk> , 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary <unk> , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 1795 . 
 The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a <unk> selected by <unk> <unk> in 1974 . It came from 57 ° 53 ′ N 11 ° 32 ′ E , near <unk> , Sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of Gothenburg ) , but both it and the <unk> have since been lost . 
 The common name for H. gammarus preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is " European lobster " , but the species is also widely known as the " common lobster " .

M @-@ 82 exits the intersection to the east . The highway runs along 48th Street through rural farms into the community of <unk> . The road , now called Main Street , passes through the downtown area and M @-@ 82 turns south along Stewart Avenue out of town . The highway rounds a curve and transitions to 72nd Street running eastward through more farm land . As the trunkline approaches <unk> , the terrain becomes more wooded near the <unk> River . M @-@ 82 follows <unk> Street east to a junction with M @-@ 37 . The two highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on State Street .

 The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) , as a part of its maintenance responsibilities , tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways . These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year . In 2009 , the department 's measurements indicated that a segment of M @-@ 82 west of <unk> had the peak volume for the highway at 16 @,@ <unk> vehicles daily .

 = = History = = 
 
 Previously inhabited by the <unk> Native Americans , the area now called Meridian was obtained by the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Dancing <unk> Creek in 1830 during the period of Indian <unk> . After the treaty was ratified , European @-@ American settlers began to move into the area . 
 After receiving a federal land grant of about 2 @,@ 000 acres ( <unk> ha ) , Richard <unk> , the first settler of Meridian , began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area . Most of <unk> 's land was bought in 1853 by Lewis A. <unk> , a lawyer from Alabama . John T. Ball , a merchant from <unk> County , bought the remaining 80 acres ( 0 @.@ 32 km2 ) . <unk> and Ball , now known as the founders of the city , began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections . 
 There was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement . Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name " Meridian , " believing the term to be synonymous with " junction " ; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred " <unk> " ( meaning " mad river " in a Native American language ) , from the name of a nearby creek ; and <unk> proposed " <unk> City . " Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad – the sign on which would alternate between " Meridian " and " <unk> " each day . Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left " Meridian " on the station permanently . The town was officially incorporated as Meridian on February 10 , 1860 . 
 Meridian was a small village at the start of the American Civil War in 1861 . Its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the Confederate construction of several military installations to support the war . During the Battle of Meridian in 1864 , General William <unk> Sherman led troops into the city , destroying the railroads in every direction , as well as an arsenal and immense <unk> ; his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground . Sherman is reported to have said afterwards , " Meridian , with its depots , store @-@ houses , arsenal , hospitals , offices , hotels , and <unk> no longer exists . " Despite the destruction , the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired , back in operation 26 working days after the battle . Race relations remained tense during the Reconstruction era , with the riot of 1871 following a fire that damaged many businesses . 
 The town <unk> in the aftermath of the Civil War , and experienced its " Golden Age " from 1880 to 1910 . The railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom . As the population rose , commercial activity increased in the downtown area . Between 1890 and 1930 , Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the South . Many of the city 's historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the Grand Opera House in 1890 , the <unk> School in 1894 , two Carnegie libraries in 1913 , and the <unk> Building , Meridian 's tallest skyscraper , in 1929 . 
 The city continued to grow thanks to a commission government 's efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s . Even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression , the city continued to attract new businesses . With <unk> becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression , the S. H. Kress & Co. building , built to " provide luxury to the common man , " opened in downtown Meridian , as did the Temple Theater , which was used as a movie house . The federal <unk> was built in 1933 as a <unk> project . 
 After a brief <unk> of the economy at the end of the Depression , the country entered World War II , which renewed the importance of railroads . The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles , so Meridian became the region 's rail center again . This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s , when the automobile and Interstate Highway System became more popular than passenger rails . The decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses , resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas . 
 During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s , Meridian was home to a Council of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) office and several other activist organizations . James <unk> and other local residents , along with Michael <unk> , his wife Rita , and Andrew Goodman , volunteers from the North , worked to create a community center , holding classes to help prepare African Americans in the area to regain the power to vote . Whites in the area resented the activism , and racial tension often resulted in violence . In June 1964 , <unk> , <unk> , and Goodman went to <unk> County , Mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned . The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian . Following a massive FBI investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam . 
 Seven <unk> , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted in the federal <unk> in Meridian of " <unk> the victims of their civil rights " and three were acquitted in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders trial . It was the first time that a white jury had convicted " a white official in a civil rights killing . " In 2005 , the case was reopened by the state , which brought charges in the case for the first time . Edgar Ray <unk> was convicted of <unk> and sentenced to 60 years in prison . Meridian later honored <unk> by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service . 
 Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made <unk> easier , residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north . After strip commercial interests began to move downtown , the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city . The Meridian Historic <unk> and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979 , and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985 . 
 Meridian Main Street organized several projects to <unk> downtown , including the construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997 based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian 's Golden Age ; it had been demolished . Other projects included the renovation of the <unk> Building in 2001 and <unk> 's Restaurant in 2002 , as well as support for integrated urban design . Meridian Main Street , along with The Riley Foundation , helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the " Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts . " 
 After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007 , the two organizations , along with the Meridian Downtown Association , spearheaded the downtown <unk> effort . The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations . Plans were underway to renovate the <unk> Building , but newly elected Mayor <unk> Barry killed the plans in early 2010 . Today , the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night . The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown .

 Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels . Even before Meridian reached its " Golden Age , " several large hotels , including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century . With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original Union Station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers . The <unk> Hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910 . Hotel Meridian was constructed in 1907 , and Union Hotel was built in 1908 . Union Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District . 
 As the city grew , the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy , as evidenced by the eleven @-@ story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927 . Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building . In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark . 
 The <unk> Young Hotel was built in 1931 . A staple in the African @-@ American business district that developed west of the city 's core , the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room . 
 As the city suburbs developed in the 1960s and ' 70s , most hotels moved outside of downtown . <unk> of the Riley Center in 2006 has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel . The <unk> Building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose , but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations . The <unk> Preservation Society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building 's renovation , featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events .

 Known for more than a century of arts , Meridian contains many art and cultural organizations and hosts many cultural events . One of the first art organizations in the city , The Meridian Art League , was established in February 1933 . Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian , but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949 , exhibitions were held at various locations around the city . After the Carnegie library at 25th <unk> and 7th St was closed , the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits . The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults . Over thirty exhibitions are held annually , ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials , photography , crafts , and many other works of art . The collection also includes 18th and 19th century portraits , 20th century photography , and several sculptures . 
 The Meridian Council for the Arts ( <unk> ) was founded as Meridian 's and Lauderdale County 's official arts agency in 1978 . <unk> operates its Community Art Grants program , the annual <unk> Festival , several workshops , and other special events each year . <unk> is partnered with many arts organizations in the city and county including the Meridian Museum of Art , the Meridian Little Theatre , and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra . Meridian Little Theatre , one of the South 's oldest subscription @-@ based community theatres , was built in 1932 and currently provides entertainment to residents of and visitors to Meridian and Lauderdale County , entertaining over 22 @,@ 000 guests each season , making it Mississippi 's most @-@ attended community theatre . The Meridian Symphony Orchestra ( <unk> ) – founded in 1961 – played its first concert in 1962 and its first full season in 1963 . In 1965 the <unk> booked its first international soloist , <unk> <unk> , to perform with the orchestra . The Orchestra helped the Meridian Public School District develop its own orchestra and strings programs and also helped develop the Meridian Symphony Chorus . The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox <unk> , who has been with the orchestra since 1991 . The <unk> will celebrate its 50th anniversary in February 2011 with a performance from <unk> <unk> . 
 The city 's former Grand Opera House was built in 1889 by two half brothers , Israel Marks and Levi <unk> . During its operation the opera house hosted many famous artists and works , the first being a German company 's rendition of Johann <unk> II 's " The <unk> Baron " . After closing in the late 1920s due to the Great Depression , the opera house was abandoned for nearly 70 years . A $ 10 million grant in 2000 by the Riley Foundation , a local foundation chartered in 1998 , sparked the building 's restoration while $ 15 million came from a combination of city , county , and federal grants . The opera house 's renovation was completed in September 2006 under the new name " Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and Performing Arts . " The Riley Center , which includes a 950 @-@ seat auditorium for live performances , a 200 @-@ seat studio theater , and 30 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 2 @,@ 787 m2 ) of meeting space , attracts more than 60 @,@ 000 visitors to downtown Meridian annually for conferences , meetings , and performances . 
 Meridian is rightly considered an architectural treasure <unk> being one the nations most intact cities from the turn of the last century . Architecture students from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their <unk> due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects . The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born <unk> Louis S. <unk> , famous for <unk> the glass curtain wall skyscraper , is extant on Highland Park . The Frank Fort designed <unk> Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco <unk> in the US and is often compared to Detroit 's famed Fisher Building . Noted California <unk> Wallace <unk> designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which <unk> the city across the nearby Alabama State line . He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean . His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of <unk> Springs Drive where his <unk> <unk> Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon <unk> , the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph <unk> . One <unk> work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s . The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had <unk> lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s <unk> and which are now in private residences on <unk> Springs Drive and in North Hills . 
 Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( <unk> ) . The Mississippi Legislature approved the idea in 2001 and in 2006 promised $ 4 million in funding if private contributors could raise $ 8 million . The city donated $ 50 @,@ 000 to the cause in September 2007 . The <unk> , as proposed , would be located on 175 acres ( 71 ha ) at <unk> Lakes and consist of an outdoor amphitheatre , an indoor concert hall , and a Hall of Fame honoring Mississippi artists . The Hall of Fame will be located downtown in the old Montana 's building . That property and the adjacent Meridian Hotel building were acquired in July 2010 for $ 300 @,@ 000 . In February 2009 , the <unk> revealed its Walk of Fame outside of the Riley Center in an attempt to promote the planned Hall of Fame . The first star on the walk was dedicated to <unk> <unk> , a Meridian native . In September of the same year , the second star was revealed , recognizing <unk> King , a famous blues musician from Mississippi . On June 1 , 2010 , authors Tennessee Williams , <unk> <unk> , and William Faulkner were added to the walk . <unk> Ward was added to the walk on June 24 , 2010 . The <unk> plans to add many more Mississippi @-@ born stars to the Walk of Fame ; names mentioned include Morgan Freeman , Jimmy <unk> , Elvis Presley , Conway <unk> , and others . 
 Another location in the city used for large productions is the <unk> Shrine Temple Theater . The Temple Theater houses a <unk> @-@ pipe Robert Morgan organ , one of two Theater <unk> still in their original installations in the state . With seating for 1800 persons , the silent movie era was a prosperous time for the Temple . At the time , it was one of the largest stages in the United States , second only to the Roxy Theater in New York City . Today , seating <unk> persons , the Temple is used year @-@ round for area events , live stage shows , plays , concerts , <unk> Shrine functions , and public screenings of classic movies . 
 Highland Park houses a <unk> <unk> museum which displays the original guitar of " The Singing <unk> " and other <unk> of his life and career , as well as railroad equipment from the steam @-@ engine era . In addition to the museum building itself , there are outside memorials , and a vintage steam <unk> on display . A Mississippi Blues Trail historic marker has been placed in Meridian to honor the city as the birthplace of <unk> <unk> and emphasizes his importance to the development of the blues style of music in Mississippi . The city was the first site to receive this designation outside the Mississippi Delta . Also , a Mississippi Country Music Trail marker was placed in Oak Grove Cemetery in honor of <unk> on June 1 , 2010 . Each year since 1953 , the city has held a festival during May to honor the anniversary of his death . 
 The park is also home to a 19th @-@ century <unk> manufactured around 1895 by Gustav <unk> of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . Highland Park <unk> <unk> has been in operation since 1909 , is a National Historic Landmark , and is the world 's only two @-@ row stationary <unk> menagerie in existence . Its house is the only remaining original <unk> building built from a <unk> <unk> . Around Town <unk> <unk> is a public arts project of 62 <unk> horses , representing the historic <unk> .

 During the Great Depression , residents of the city contemplated abandoning the airport because of the cost of maintenance , but in 1935 Brothers Fred and Al Key , managers of the airport , thought of a way to keep the airport operating . From June 4 until July 1 , 1935 , the brothers flew over the city in their plane , the " Ole Miss . " The record they established in their 27 days <unk> , totaling 653 hours and 34 minutes , attracted enough publicity and funds to the city to keep the airport running .

 Early public education in Meridian was based on the 1870 Mississippi Constitution . From 1870 to 1885 , trustees appointed by the City Council served on the Board of School Directors , which had authority to operate the schools . Although there were several schools in the city before 1884 , they were privately owned and only enrolled about 400 students . The city did not build its first publicly owned school until September 1884 . The first public school for blacks in the city was held in facilities rented from St. Paul Methodist Church . The Mississippi Legislature amended the city charter in January 1888 to allow the city to maintain its own municipal school district , and in March of the same year $ 30 @,@ 000 in bonds was approved for the city to build new public schools . From this bond , the <unk> School was built in 1894 , becoming the first brick public school building in the state built for blacks . 
 From this early district and later additions , the Meridian Public School District grew to its current size , which now includes six elementary schools , 3 middle schools , and 3 high schools . The city also contains several private schools including Lamar School , <unk> Christian School , Community Christian School , and St. Patrick 's Catholic School . The campus of Meridian High School , the main high school in the district , occupies 37 acres ( 15 ha ) , including six buildings and 111 classrooms .

 Meridian is served by the Meridian @-@ Lauderdale County Public Library , located at the corner of 7th Street and 26th Avenue . The city originally had two Carnegie libraries , both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites . A group of women had formed the <unk> Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city . The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian . With wide support for the library , the club enlisted Israel Marks , a city leader , to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance . The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church , and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian , who sold it to the city on September 25 , 1911 . The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country . The two libraries served the city until 1967 , when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , combined their collections , and moved all materials to their current location . The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970 , and the former African @-@ American library was demolished on May 28 , 2008 .

 The main settlement on the island today is <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> and is surrounded by in @-@ bye land to the east of the hill <unk> ( which runs south from West <unk> ) . To the west the island is <unk> by a belt of glacial <unk> about one and a half kilometres in length . Much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow <unk> soil that may be derived from glacial till . There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile . The lack of peat led to ' turf <unk> ' for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior . 
 The highest point on the island is in the north west at <unk> Field , which rises to 87 metres ( 285 feet ) . <unk> is possibly from the Old Norse for ' <unk> of stones ' .

 On 21 June 2008 , Stuart Hill , the owner and only resident of the 1 hectare ( 2 @.@ 5 acres ) island of <unk> <unk> ( which he has renamed " <unk> Island " ) made a declaration of dependence , creating the Crown <unk> of <unk> . On the basis of a marriage arrangement between King Christian of Norway and King James III of Scotland that dates to <unk> , Hill argued that the island should be considered a British crown dependency , and thus not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union . This claim was not recognised by the United Kingdom .

 The island is composed of a variety of volcanic and <unk> rock formations from the Devonian period . At that time the Scottish <unk> formed part of the Old Red <unk> Continent and lay some 10 @-@ 25 degrees south of the equator . The <unk> of Old Red <unk> , laid down from <unk> to 370 million years ago , were created as earlier <unk> rocks , <unk> by the formation of <unk> , eroded and then were deposited into river <unk> . The freshwater Lake <unk> existed on the edges of the eroding mountains , stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth . The structure of Papa <unk> is largely made up of ashes and <unk> from volcanic activity associated with this period , including bands of solidified volcanic ash and <unk> ( <unk> ) , but there is also a Devonian fish bed at <unk> Banks . There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene <unk> . 
 <unk> of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , <unk> , arches , <unk> , cliffs , <unk> and <unk> that are amongst the finest in Britain . The ' Holl o <unk> ' is a cave that passes right through the north @-@ west tip of the island . It is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through . <unk> ( or Christie 's ) Hole in the south west is another spectacular cave , part of the roof of which collapsed in 1981 . Yet another is ' <unk> 's Hole ' close to <unk> <unk> in the west . This was the favourite of John Tudor who wrote of the island in his Victorian memoirs and described the cave as : 
 ... in <unk> , so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so <unk> is the water ... [ with ] <unk> or <unk> like <unk> in a church . 
 In 1953 the spectacular headland , ' Da Horn o Papa ' fell into the sea during a storm . The nearby <unk> of <unk> <unk> also has caves that can be accessed by small boats when conditions permit .

 Human settlement of the island dates from circa 3000 BC and there are remains of several Neolithic burial chambers known as ' heel @-@ shaped <unk> ' . Little is known of the pre @-@ Celtic and Celtic eras , but when the Norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from <unk> <unk> meaning " Big island of the <unk> " ( Celtic monks ) , in distinction to Papa Little some 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) to the west .

 Papa <unk> is the subject of a <unk> manuscript written in Old Norse , which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland . It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke <unk> <unk> , who was later to become King <unk> V of Norway . There is a circle of stones near the beach at <unk> <unk> , which are the remains of a ' <unk> ' , or local assembly . This was the scene of a duel , fought and won by Lord <unk> <unk> , who was accused of corruption in the <unk> document and was later called ‘ <unk> de <unk> ’ . ( The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above . ) The remains of Duke <unk> 's thirteenth @-@ century house are still visible near <unk> <unk> .

 In <unk> Shetland came under nominal Scottish control , although the Norse ' <unk> of Norway ' kept their Papa <unk> estates until the 17th century . In the 16th century merchants from <unk> and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet . By the 18th century , two Scottish <unk> , Thomas <unk> of <unk> , and Arthur <unk> of <unk> , owned the island . They maintained a prosperous <unk> ( Old Norse : ' deep sea ' ) fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using six @-@ <unk> boats known as <unk> . 
 In addition to the <unk> colony on <unk> <unk> there may have been another at <unk> <unk> overlooking <unk> <unk> . A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony . 
 The island church , which <unk> Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore <unk> , was founded in 1806 . 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of <unk> or <unk> on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of <unk> . It is called the ' <unk> <unk> ' by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as " the site of a <unk> chapel belonging to about the twelfth century " . There is a tradition that the work there was <unk> with by supernatural powers and that each day 's work on the building was destroyed during the night . Eventually the <unk> were moved overnight by these <unk> agencies to the present site of the church and work was re @-@ commenced there successfully . Excavations in 2004 found little besides large blocks of <unk> and a piece of whalebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it . 
 In the 19th century the <unk> fishing station in West <unk> was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more . However , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam <unk> saw a fall in population from the 1870s on . At this time another duel entered the history of Papa <unk> . Edwin Lindsay , an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of <unk> , was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one . He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835 . Lindsay 's Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe . 
 There are good examples of horizontal water mills , also known as Norse or <unk> Mills , around Dutch Loch . Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs , built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill @-@ stone was sited . Inside the building there was a fixed lower <unk> , and a rotating upper <unk> driven by the water falling onto the <unk> below . Some were still in use on Papa <unk> in the early years of the 20th century , and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of <unk> , at <unk> in the south <unk> of Shetland .

 In common with many small Scottish islands , Papa <unk> 's population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e.g. <unk> ) . By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen ' fairly elderly ' residents , but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline . A <unk> and five sheep were offered free of charge to <unk> which brought a flood of applicants . By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33 . However , by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious <unk> between <unk> led to several court cases . A number of people left the island and the school closed . By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left . The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011 @-@ 11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 .

 The coasts around Papa <unk> have claimed numerous wrecks . In <unk> , <unk> <unk> alone has sunk Dutch , French , German and Norwegian ships . 
 The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> 3 miles northwest of Papa <unk> , on the evening of 28 March 1930 while on her way to the village of <unk> to land her catch . When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw , and reported the wreck . By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the <unk> and local volunteers ( there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time ) , weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the <unk> . A request had been made for the <unk> lifeboat from Orkney , only 120 miles away , to launch , but the request was made too late to be of help . All 9 crew perished in the wreck . Only 3 bodies were recovered , that of James Mitchell , which was returned to Aberdeen , and the bodies of J. <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which were buried in <unk> . 
 The cargo ship SS <unk> ran aground in fog on <unk> <unk> in February 1940 . On this occasion the conditions were <unk> and only the ship and cargo were lost . In 1967 the Aberdeen trawler <unk> ran aground in <unk> Sound at the bottom of the 60 metres ( 200 feet ) cliffs . The 12 man crew were rescued by the <unk> lifeboat , the <unk> being awarded the <unk> silver medal for this rescue . 
 Papa <unk> 's most recent <unk> occurred on 9 December 1977 when the Aberdeen trawler Elinor Viking <unk> , <unk> Alec <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions .

They managed to <unk> all the boat 's crew to safety within hours of the <unk> , despite the storm force winds . The helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery . There was no loss of life , but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the <unk> in 1979 , and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit , based at <unk> Airport .

 The Papa <unk> sword dance may be of Norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of England . A description of the dance appears in The Pirate by Sir Walter Scott . 
 The writer and journalist John Sands lived on Papa <unk> and <unk> for a while during the late nineteenth century . The writer , <unk> and musician , George P. S. Peterson was brought up on Papa <unk> . 
 It is also the ' Papa ' of <unk> 's poem Da Sang o da Papa men , now adopted as part of the <unk> tradition , as set to music by <unk> Manson . The <unk> chorus chant , ' <unk> <unk> <unk> ! ' , is particularly striking . 
 " <unk> <unk> da Horn o Papa ,

 " <unk> <unk> <unk> ! " refers to the <unk> ' practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of <unk> were no longer visible . This entailed the boat being some 96 kilometres ( 60 mi ) west of Papa <unk> . The ' tide @-@ <unk> ' are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide . The <unk> final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to Papa by the ' scent o <unk> ' across the water . This is an example of <unk> 's ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation . An extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem 's composition , so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life , but a noted geographical feature .

 " Angel of Death " is the opening track on the American thrash metal band Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood . The lyrics and music were written by Slayer guitarist , Jeff Hanneman and are based on Nazi physician <unk> <unk> , who conducted human experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . " Angel of Death " led to the band facing accusations of Nazi <unk> and racism throughout their career . 
 Despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of Reign in Blood , " Angel of Death " is featured on all of Slayer 's live albums and DVDs and has appeared in several movies . The song was well received by critics ; Steve Huey of AllMusic described it as a " classic " .

 Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote " Angel of Death " after reading books about Nazi physician <unk> <unk> while on tour with the band : " I remember stopping <unk> where I bought two books on <unk> . I thought , ' This has gotta be some sick shit . ' So when it came time to do the record , that stuff was still in my head — that 's where the lyrics to ' Angel of Death ' came from . " 
 The lyrics detail <unk> 's surgical experiments on patients at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . <unk> 's <unk> were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins , and included both physical and psychological examinations . Among the tests he performed that are mentioned in " Angel of Death " are experimental <unk> performed without anesthesia , transfusion of blood between twins , isolation endurance , <unk> , <unk> with lethal <unk> , sex change operations , the removal of organs and limbs , and <unk> . 
 " <unk> together , joining heads . Just a matter of time ' <unk> you rip <unk> apart " , a line from the penultimate verse , is a reference to the allegation <unk> <unk> together twins , one of them deformed ; " the <unk> was <unk> to the other child , back to back , their wrists back to back too . " This claim was first made by Auschwitz survivor <unk> Alexander at the 1961 trial of SS @-@ <unk> Adolf <unk> the " architect of the Holocaust " , where it was asserted that <unk> " <unk> the veins together " and turned " them into <unk> twins . " This allegation became more widely known when <unk> Alexander was featured in the 1985 documentary The Search for <unk> , which has been cited by several authors including Gerald <unk> , an expert on <unk> . 
 Towards the end of the song , there is a line " Feeding off the screams of the <unk> he 's creating " , which was taken from the film The Boys from Brazil in which Dr. <unk> was the villain .

 The lyrical content of " Angel of Death " contributed to the delay of the release of Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood . The band were signed to Def Jam Records whose distributor , Columbia Records , refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns , deeming the artwork " too graphic " . Reign in Blood was eventually distributed by Geffen Records on October 7 , 1986 . However , due to the controversy , Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records official release schedule . 
 " Angel of Death " caused outrage among survivors of the Holocaust , as well as their families and the general public . The controversy led to accusations of Nazi <unk> which have followed Slayer throughout their career . People took Hanneman 's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals as evidence of <unk> – his most prized item being a German Knight 's Cross . Hanneman <unk> asserting : 
 " I know why people <unk> it – it 's because they get this knee – <unk> reaction to it . When they read the lyrics , there 's nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man , because to me – well , isn 't that obvious ? I shouldn 't have to tell you that . " 
 According to guitarist Kerry King : " Yeah , ' Slayer are Nazis , fascists , communists ' — all that fun shit . And of course we got the most <unk> for it in Germany . I was always like , ' Read the lyrics and tell me what 's offensive about it . Can you see it as a documentary , or do you think Slayer 's preaching fucking World War II ? ' People get this thought in their heads — especially in Europe — and you 'll never talk them out of it . " 
 The song drew accusations of racism , which the band has denied . The band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews , and have stated numerous times that they do not <unk> racism and are merely interested in the subject . 
 In 2006 , the song " <unk> " from Slayer 's 2006 album Christ Illusion drew comparison to " Angel of Death " . " <unk> " deals with the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , and tells the story from a terrorist 's perspective . <unk> Araya was expecting the subject matter to create a similar backlash to that of " Angel of Death " , although it did not <unk> , in part , he believes , due to peoples ' view that the song is " just Slayer being Slayer " .

 " The <unk> Blues " is a blues song by American folk and blues musician , Lead <unk> . It was written in June 1937 in response to the discrimination and segregation that Lead <unk> faced during a visit to Washington , DC to record for Alan <unk> . It rails against racism , the Jim Crow laws , and the conditions of contemporary African Americans in the southern United States . 
 The song was recorded in December 1938 for the Library of Congress and re @-@ recorded in 1939 for commercial release . It has been remixed and covered by a number of artists including Pete Seeger , <unk> <unk> , Hans <unk> , and Billy Bragg . 
 " The <unk> Blues " is regarded as one of Lead <unk> 's best original works , but it also drew controversy . There is doubt over the song 's authorship , with some scholars <unk> that Lead <unk> was unlikely to have written a work in a genre new to him without a collaborator . <unk> have been raised over his role in the American Communist Party and whether he and the song were used to further the party 's political goals .

 Most music historians date the writing of " The <unk> Blues " to Lead <unk> 's June 1937 trip to Washington , DC , when he was invited by the <unk> Alan <unk> to record for the Library of Congress 's folk music collection . On the first night Lead <unk> and his wife Martha spent in the city , they encountered racially <unk> Jim Crow laws similar to those found in their native Louisiana : most hotels refused to rent rooms to African Americans and the few that would were either full or refused to serve him because he was with a white man ( <unk> ) . <unk> , in some versions of the story described as an unnamed " white friend " , offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the Supreme Court Building . The next morning , Lead <unk> <unk> to <unk> arguing with his <unk> about the presence of a black man , with the <unk> threatening to call the police . 
 While in Washington , Lead <unk> encountered several other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the <unk> of the song . For instance , when Lead <unk> , <unk> , and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together , they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them . Lead <unk> was told that if he returned later without <unk> , he would be served . 
 In response to one of these incidents , a friend of Lead <unk> 's , variously identified as either <unk> or Mary Elizabeth <unk> joked that Washington was a " <unk> town . " Though Lead <unk> did not know what the word " <unk> " meant , he was fascinated by the sound of it , and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip . The song came together quickly ; one account claims that it only took a few hours for Lead <unk> to write it . <unk> liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment .

 " The <unk> Blues " is a blues @-@ style protest song that criticizes the culture of Washington , DC . It protests against both the city 's Jim Crow laws and the racism of its white population . Its structure includes several verses and a refrain that declares that the speaker is going to " spread the news all around " about the racial issues <unk> the city . The song , particularly in the refrain , <unk> race and economics by referring to <unk> as " <unk> " . 
 The first two verses speak of the segregation that Lead <unk> encountered in Washington DC : the first recounts the fact that during the trip , Lead <unk> was " turned down " wherever he tried to get served due to his race , while the second recounts the argument between <unk> and his <unk> over Lead <unk> staying in his apartment . The third verse <unk> cites " the home of the brave , the land of the Free " , juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white people in Washington , DC . The fourth verse speaks of the racism of the white population of the city , leading to the song 's end , which suggests that African Americans boycott buying homes in the district . 
 The song 's tone implies that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism that he encounters ; despite this , by " spreading the news " of his poor treatment in a song , the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern African Americans and northern whites that the status <unk> is deeply flawed and that something needs to change . 
 " The <unk> Blues " follows a traditional twelve @-@ bar blues format . It is written in 44 time but <unk> to note that the song <unk> should swing at medium <unk> . The song was written in B ♭ . It uses twelve measures with verses one to four repeating , followed by the final two verses and a <unk> .

 " The <unk> Blues " is one of Lead <unk> 's most famous songs and is remembered as his most " heartfelt protest song " . There is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance . Robert <unk> claims that the song is " peripheral " to the wider study of the blues , while Lawson points to it as a watershed in the way African Americans see themselves in the fabric of the United States . There is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics . After its release , it became popular with left @-@ wing political groups . Lead <unk> was invited to perform at Camp Unity , the Communist Party USA 's summer retreat , and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s . This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform . The party claims , to the contrary , that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform . 
 Jeff Todd <unk> and several other writers have suggested that Lead <unk> had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song . This theory stems from the idea that Lead <unk> did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by <unk> . Since the music that <unk> recorded was sold to <unk> sympathetic to Civil Rights , it has been suggested that <unk> helped him write a song attractive to a white audience . Lead <unk> admitted that the term " <unk> " was unfamiliar to him , and it seems out of place compared to the vocabulary of his past work .

 " <unk> " was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance <unk> , along with " <unk> Up " and " Future Lovers " . It was also the one which took the most time to finish because Madonna " thought it was too melodramatic and could never decide when it was right . " The songs were developed with a remixed perspective in mind . Madonna commented that , " Whenever I make records , I often like the remixes better than the original ones . [ ... ] So I thought , screw that . I 'm going to start from that perspective " . She promoted the album at the dance party " <unk> " held at Luke & <unk> 's nightclub in Greenwich Village , invited by Junior <unk> to take over the DJ booth where she mixed " <unk> Up " with " <unk> " .

It then changes to <unk> – <unk> @-@ <unk> in the chorus , while continuing in A ♭ – <unk> – A ♭ – <unk> in the intermediate verses , ultimately ending in repeated lines of " I 've heard it all before " . 
 Lyrically the song has <unk> of different languages including French , Spanish , Italian , Dutch , Hebrew , Hindi , Polish and Japanese . The song talks about personal <unk> and self @-@ <unk> , denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like " Everybody " ( 1982 ) , " Vogue " ( 1990 ) or " Music " ( 2000 ) which was centered around the subject of music itself . Among the various remixes , the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston 's " I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) " with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction . Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other , from the time they wrote the song " Heart " ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it . The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album <unk> Four . Madonna 's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook . A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends , leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends .

 = High Five Interchange = 
 
 The High Five Interchange is one of the first five @-@ level stack interchanges built in Dallas , Texas . Located at the junction of the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ( Interstate 635 , I @-@ 635 ) and the Central Expressway ( US Highway 75 , US 75 ) , it replaces an <unk> partial cloverleaf interchange constructed in the 1960s . 
 The $ 261 million project was started in 2002 and completed in December 2005 . It was designed by the <unk> Corporation and built by <unk> Construction Corporation . 
 The interchange is considered by Popular <unk> to be one of " The World 's 18 <unk> <unk> " because of its height ( as high as a 12 @-@ story building ) , its 43 permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features . In 2006 , the American Public Works Association named the High Five Interchange as " Public Works <unk> of the Year " .

 The High Five Interchange , north of downtown in Dallas , Texas , is a massive five @-@ level freeway interchange . It is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic , the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ( Interstate 635 ) and the Central Expressway ( US 75 ) , and is the first five @-@ level stack interchange to be built in the city . 
 It replaces the <unk> three @-@ level , modified cloverleaf interchange built in the 1960s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing US 75 down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways . The looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically , backing up traffic . Left @-@ hand exits contributed to the congestion . Further , its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other , making local access difficult . 
 <unk> to the celebratory gesture , the " High Five " name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @-@ turn movements that tower over the landscape . The interchange is as high as a 12 @-@ story building , and includes 43 bridges spread across five levels ( the " High Five " ) , 710 support tiers , and 60 miles of additional highway . The highest ramps are 120 feet ( 37 m ) above ground . The lanes of US 75 , which are on the bottom level , are 20 feet ( 6 m ) below ground level , giving the structure a total height of 140 feet from bottom to top As part of the project , I @-@ 635 was widened to include four dedicated high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes ( <unk> lanes ) that are barrier @-@ separated and <unk> . 
 The roads on the five levels are : 
 Level I : US 75 , an eight lane highway , four lanes going each way 
 Level II : The junction of the two six @-@ lane frontage roads , each having three through lanes in each direction , left @-@ turn lanes and <unk> , and easy access to US 75 and I @-@ 635 
 Level III : I @-@ 635 , ten regular lanes , five going each way , and four <unk> lanes ( two going each way ) separated by barriers 
 Level IV and V : Direct connection ramps ( two levels ) , eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf 
 The interchange , with its decorative <unk> on <unk> concrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the Texas Department of Transportation ( <unk> ) , can be regarded as an enormous work of public art . The High Five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail , named the <unk> Trail , which runs under all levels of the interchange . The section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the High Five project by <unk> . 
 The interchange is considered by Popular <unk> as one of " The World 's 18 <unk> <unk> " , calling it a " labyrinth of lanes " and a " five @-@ level <unk> of engineering " because of its height , the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 The High Five Interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing , <unk> interchange that accommodated 500 @,@ 000 vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in Dallas . It was a collaborative project between the <unk> , affected motorists and property owners , and the primary contractor , <unk> Construction . An essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible . 
 Reasons for upgrading the interchange , in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion , were to improve air quality , safety , and local access . 
 <unk> Construction Corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the $ 261 million contract by <unk> , the largest ever by that agency . The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts . For example , it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete 's strength ( the first time <unk> had ever done so ) , and contained an early completion bonus , a <unk> scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years . Also built into the construction contract was a provision that <unk> was charged for " lane rentals " by <unk> for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on <unk> assessments and the time of day the lane was closed . The fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush hours . In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and <unk> so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed . Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished . 
 To save time and money , innovative construction methods were employed : The original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans ( used to direct @-@ connect roads ) to be made of steel , but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction , cast @-@ in @-@ place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans . However , <unk> decided to use <unk> concrete segmental bridges , rather than casting the bridge elements in place , and used a unique machine , designed and constructed by Deal <unk> of Italy and costing about $ 1 million , to move the pieces into place . 
 During the construction , 2 @.@ 2 million cubic yards of <unk> was used , 350 @,@ 000 cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site , and 300 @,@ 000 square feet of retaining walls were built . Additionally , 40 @,@ 000 feet of drilled shafts and 75 @,@ 000 linear feet of drainage pipe were completed . In addition to the construction of 43 permanent bridges , six temporary bridges were built , resulting in 2 @.@ 3 million square feet of bridge deck . 
 The project was designed by the <unk> Corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction , which had begun in 2002 and was completed in December 2005 , more than 13 months sooner than planned .

 In 2006 , the American Public Works Association named the High Five " Public Works Project of the Year " for its massive size , its innovative design , the complexity and <unk> of its construction and the need it fulfilled for the community . <unk> as the managing agency , <unk> Construction Corporation as the primary contractor , and <unk> Corporation as the primary consultant received the award in recognition of their cooperative alliance in completing the project .

 Tim Richmond ( June 7 , 1955 – August 13 , 1989 ) was an American race car driver from <unk> , Ohio . He competed in <unk> racing before transferring to <unk> 's Winston Cup Series ( now <unk> Cup Series ) . Richmond was one of the first drivers to change from open wheel racing to <unk> stock cars full @-@ time , which has since become an industry trend . He won the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award and had 13 victories during eight <unk> seasons . 
 Richmond achieved his top <unk> season in 1986 when he finished third in points . He won seven races that season , more than any other driver on the tour . When he missed the season @-@ opening <unk> 500 in February 1987 , media reported that he had pneumonia . The infection most likely resulted from his compromised immune system , which was weakened by AIDS . Despite the state of his health , Richmond competed in eight races in 1987 , winning two events and one pole position before his final race in August of that year . He attempted a comeback in 1988 before <unk> I banned him for testing positive for excessive <unk> ( over the counter ) drugs , <unk> and <unk> ; <unk> later announced they gave Tim Richmond a new test and tested negative . Tim Richmond filed a lawsuit against <unk> after <unk> insisted they wanted access to his entire medical record before they would reinstate him , after losing the lawsuit , Richmond withdrew from racing . <unk> later stated their original test was a " Bad Test . " 
 Richmond grew up in a wealthy family and lived a <unk> lifestyle , earning him the nickname " Hollywood " . In describing Richmond 's influence in racing , Charlotte Motor <unk> president <unk> Wheeler said : " We 've never had a race driver like Tim in stock car racing . He was almost a James Dean @-@ like character . " When Richmond was cast for a bit part in the 1983 movie <unk> Ace , " He fell right in with the group working on the film , " said director Hal <unk> . Cole <unk> , the main character in the movie Days of Thunder , played by Tom Cruise , was loosely based on Richmond and his interaction with Harry Hyde and Rick <unk> .

 Richmond grew up in <unk> , Ohio . His parents , Al and Evelyn ( née Warner ) Richmond , met in the course of their work . Al was a <unk> for pipe construction companies and Evelyn was a field office manager . <unk> that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe , Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway . To market this invention , he founded Richmond Manufacturing , which eventually exported machines worldwide . 
 Tim 's driving days started as a <unk> when he was given a go @-@ <unk> that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn . He later raced the <unk> at tracks in <unk> and New <unk> . Richmond grew up in a well @-@ to @-@ do family , and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates , so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami , Florida . During his years in Miami , Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio . While home in Ohio over a summer break , he met local drag <unk> Raymond <unk> through lifelong friend Fred Miller . When Richmond reached age 16 , his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am , a <unk> and a Piper <unk> airplane for his birthday . Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about <unk> her only son . She once said , " Tim was lazy ... " , and " ... I did everything for him . I ruined him , I admit it . He was my whole life . " 
 Richmond excelled in sports ; he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his <unk> days were over . Miami Military Academy named him <unk> of the Year in 1970 . Richmond 's other interests included flying , and he earned his private pilot license at age 16 . Following high school graduation , Richmond attended <unk> University for about one year before dropping out .

 A friend of Richmond 's father co @-@ owned a sprint car and Richmond joined the team as a crew member for Dave Shoemaker . In 1976 , 21 @-@ year @-@ old Richmond took the car onto <unk> <unk> at <unk> , Ohio for some practice laps . " Somebody put a <unk> on me , " Richmond said . " I was running laps faster than Dave had been . It was the first time I had ever driven a race car . " Richmond and his father found a red , white and blue @-@ colored No. 98 car in Pennsylvania , which was the same number and paint scheme that Richmond used on model cars as a child . In his first competition at the track , officials placed Richmond in the slowest heat . He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle . Although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction , the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight . After being towed to the pits , he parked the car for the rest of the event . Later that season , they towed the car to <unk> <unk> , only to have Richmond crash the car again . In response , Richmond 's father fired him as the driver . The next season , Al Richmond bought a <unk> better suited to his son 's driving style . In 1977 Tim Richmond became both <unk> <unk> 's Rookie of the Year and the <unk> class track champion . 
 Richmond returned to racing sprint cars in the United States Automobile Club 's ( <unk> ) national sprint car tour in 1978 . <unk> in 12 races , he finished 30th in points as the series ' Rookie of the Year . That year he attended Jim Russell 's road racing school at <unk> Springs International <unk> Park , setting a student course record . Richmond raced in a 1978 Mini <unk> car event at Phoenix International <unk> , winning the Formula Super <unk> support event in a <unk> <unk> . The win attracted sponsors and attention from major owners like Roger <unk> . He also competed in <unk> 's Silver Crown series . 
 Richmond 's father bought an Eagle <unk> Car chassis and an <unk> engine for the 1979 race at Michigan International <unk> . Richmond qualified 21st fastest with a 175 @.@ <unk> mph ( <unk> @.@ <unk> km / h ) lap , significantly slower than Bobby <unk> 's 203 @.@ <unk> mph ( <unk> @.@ 111 km / h ) pole position speed . The race ended for him when his motor blew up on the fourth lap , and he finished last ( 23rd ) . <unk> Pat <unk> was looking for a driver to replace Larry Rice for his <unk> team at the following race at Watkins Glen International , so he gave Richmond a test at <unk> Spring where he had previously set the student record . <unk> hired Richmond , who then qualified 15th fastest for the event and finished in eighth place , the best of his <unk> career . Richmond raced in three more events that season . 
 After crashing during the first day of qualifying for the 1980 Indianapolis 500 , Richmond nevertheless obtained the 19th starting position in the race . He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race , led a lap , and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race . To the delight of the crowd , winner Johnny Rutherford gave him a ride back to the pits . He was named the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year . " I <unk> up a few <unk> cars right after that , " he said . " Milwaukee , Mid @-@ Ohio . . . at Michigan I cut one in two . I was afraid my racing career would come to a halt . So when I got an offer to drive stock cars , I took it , and it turned out I liked driving them better . "

 <unk> <unk> President Joseph <unk> III convinced Richmond to make the change to stock car racing on the <unk> circuit . Richmond made his first <unk> start two months after winning the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award . He debuted at the Coca @-@ Cola 500 at <unk> on July 27 , 1980 , finishing 12th in a D. K. <unk> @-@ owned <unk> . That season , he competed in five events , with two <unk> ( did not finish ) and three 12th @-@ place finishes . Overall , he finished the 1980 season 41st in points . 
 Richmond raced for three teams in 1981 . He started the season by competing in 15 events for <unk> . He had his first career top 10 finish , taking sixth place at <unk> <unk> , soon followed by a seventh @-@ place finish at Texas World <unk> . After <unk> <unk> hired him away from <unk> mid @-@ season , Richmond had top 10 finishes at <unk> and Bristol . For the final seven races of the season , he drove for Bob Rogers and had a top 10 finish at Dover International <unk> . Overall for the season , Richmond had six top 10 finishes to place 16th in season points . 
 Richmond started 1982 without a ride before getting a one @-@ race deal to drive for Billie Harvey at the <unk> track . Richmond completed 112 laps of the <unk> @-@ lap event to finish 31st , retiring from the race with engine problems . For the following event , Richmond was hired to drive <unk> Stacy 's No. 2 car . In his first race for the team , Richmond earned his first career top 5 finish when he placed fifth at Darlington <unk> . Returning to <unk> , he finished second , before winning his first race on the road course at Riverside , California the following week . Later that season , he earned his first pole position at Bristol . The tour returned to Riverside for the final race of the season where Richmond won his second race , sweeping both events at the track . Benny Parsons said that " watching Richmond go through the <unk> was unbelievable " . For the season , Richmond had twelve top 10s , two wins , and one pole to finish 26th in points . 
 In 1983 , Richmond began racing for Raymond <unk> whom he had known before he started racing . He returned to the three @-@ cornered <unk> racetrack , earning his first oval victory . During the season , he accumulated four pole positions ( Darlington , <unk> , Charlotte , and Atlanta ) , one win ( <unk> ) , and fifteen top 10s on his way to finishing tenth in season points . He made his first appearance in a <unk> Busch Series ( now Nationwide Series ) car , but did not finish any of the three races he entered that season . 
 <unk> magazine named Richmond as one of " the best of the new generation " in 1984 . That year he had one win at North <unk> <unk> and second @-@ place finishes at Dover , Darlington and Riverside . Richmond finished the 1984 season 12th in points , with 11 finishes in the top 10 and in six in the top 5 . In 1985 , the final season that Richmond competed for <unk> , his best finish was a second @-@ place run at Bristol . He ended the season 11th in points with 13 Top 10s in 28 races . In the Busch Series , he qualified at the pole position in the two races he entered , and won the Charlotte race . 
 Richmond joined <unk> <unk> in 1986 , where he teamed up with veteran crew chief Harry Hyde . It took the team until the middle of the season to gel . Richmond had suffered a 64 @-@ race <unk> streak that was finally broken at the Van <unk> Diamond Mine 500 at <unk> in June 1986 . After two straight second @-@ place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside , Richmond started the <unk> event in third place inside the second row . That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point . <unk> wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official , so the <unk> body had the drivers slowly circle the track . It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps , and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their <unk> . Two hours later , the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third . After Richmond 's car was adjusted to remove the " push " , the car was more to his liking . Because his radio did not work , he was unable to communicate with his crew chief , Hyde , and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left . Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end . After Richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the race , Dale <unk> made up three seconds on Richmond 's five @-@ second lead . With four laps to go , <unk> <unk> spun in a three @-@ car accident . The remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and Richmond took the <unk> flag for the victory . He had led 97 laps , including the final 30 , taking his first victory in a Rick <unk> car . 
 The tour returned to <unk> a month later , and Richmond battled for another victory in a fog @-@ shortened event . In the final 8 @-@ lap sprint , Richmond competed in a three @-@ car battle with Geoff <unk> and Ricky <unk> . Richmond crossed the finish line beside <unk> , winning the race by 0 @.@ 05 seconds . He notched four more victories that season , and over a span of twelve races , Richmond earned three second @-@ place finishes , and six wins . The National <unk> Press Association named him Co @-@ Driver of the Year with <unk> after Richmond accumulated 13 top 5 finishes and 16 in the top 10 . He had a career @-@ best third @-@ place finish in points after winning seven events in 1986 , in what was his last full <unk> season .

 Richmond fell ill the day after the 1986 <unk> annual banquet during a promotional trip to New York . He was not well enough to begin the 1987 <unk> season despite lengthy hospitalization in Cleveland and further rest at home ; when Richmond missed the <unk> 500 , his condition was reported as double pneumonia . Media later reported that he had tested positive for acquired immune <unk> syndrome ( AIDS ) . He returned to <unk> for the Miller High Life 500 during the middle of the year . Starting third , he led by the fifth lap and ultimately led 82 laps , including the final 46 , to win the race by eight car @-@ lengths over Bill Elliott . In the middle of the race , Richmond 's car suffered <unk> problems . Because he could use only fourth ( high ) gear , he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits . Richmond was emotional after the victory , saying , " I had tears in my eyes when I took the <unk> flag . Then every time anyone <unk> me , I started <unk> again . " Richmond earned a victory in the next race at Riverside , and made his final 1987 start at Michigan International <unk> 's Champion <unk> <unk> 400 that August , finishing 29th with a blown engine . He resigned from <unk> <unk> in September 1987 . 
 Although Richmond attempted a comeback in 1988 , <unk> suspended him for testing positive for banned substances . The substances were identified as <unk> , a non @-@ <unk> over @-@ the @-@ counter allergy medication , and <unk> , an over @-@ the @-@ counter pain reliever . In April 1988 , Richmond sued <unk> over the suspension . Although he <unk> later that year and was reinstated , he could not find a car to drive . In his final public appearance in February 1988 , Richmond denied that he abused drugs and said that a mistake had been made in his drug test . His suit with <unk> was settled out @-@ of @-@ court , the terms sealed . 
 Richmond withdrew into his <unk> in Florida . There were by then rumors of HIV and AIDS , which he denied . He was later hospitalized in West Palm Beach . 
 ESPN sent a get @-@ well @-@ soon card to Richmond when it aired the July 1989 <unk> race at <unk> . The television network showed highlights of Richmond 's victory at the track from 1986 . " Tim had Hollywood good looks and the <unk> of Tom Cruise , " said his friend Dr. Jerry Punch . " There he was in victory lane with the team all around him and beauty queens hanging all over him . It was important for the people at the hospital to see Tim the way he really was , when he was healthy and handsome and vital , not the way he was as they saw him every day in the hospital . " 
 On August 13 , 1989 , Richmond died at the age of 34 , about two years after his final <unk> race . He was buried in <unk> , Ohio . 
 The secrecy surrounding the circumstance of his death caused speculation for several days . At the time , Punch stated that Richmond had been hospitalized due to a motorcycle accident , though it is unlikely that Richmond had the strength to ride a motorcycle during his last months . Ten days after his death , on August 23 , the Richmond family held a press conference to reveal that Richmond died from complications from AIDS , which he acquired from an unknown woman . Richmond 's physician , Dr. David Dodson , said : " There 's no way of knowing who that woman was . Tim was a celebrity with a lot of <unk> , a handsome guy . He naturally attracted a lot of women . " Punch later claimed that more than 90 drivers and personnel underwent HIV testing in the wake of Richmond 's death .

A series of drug tests and falsely reported positive results shortly before the 1988 <unk> 500 kept Richmond from driving in what was to have been his last big race ... " , the report said . The New York Times published the findings . While neither Tennant nor <unk> supplied an official response at the time , <unk> did confirm that they were seeking to replace Tennant . 
 The <unk> County Sports Hall of Fame inducted Richmond in their second class in 1996 . In 1998 , <unk> named Richmond one of its 50 greatest drivers of all time . He was inducted into the International <unk> Hall of Fame in 2002 . The Mansfield <unk> Park <unk> Re / Max Series race in 2009 was named the Tim Richmond Memorial <unk> Re / Max 250 in honor of the area native . The race at Mansfield was co @-@ promoted by <unk> 's son Joseph <unk> III .

 The <unk> Creek Mountains are a remote , semi @-@ arid Great Basin mountain range mostly in southeastern Oregon and partially in northern Nevada in the United States . The range 's highest point is <unk> View <unk> , 8 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 593 m ) above sea level , in Nevada . Disaster Peak , elevation 7 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 372 m ) , is another prominent summit in the Nevada portion of the mountains . 
 The mountains are characteristic of the Great Basin 's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys . <unk> generally north to south , the <unk> Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt , which came from an ancient volcano and other <unk> , on top of older <unk> rocks . The southern end of the range , however , features many <unk> <unk> . As a whole , the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by <unk> and canyons . 
 Most of the range is public land administered by the federal Bureau of Land Management . There is very little human development in the remote region — cattle grazing and <unk> are the primary human uses — but former mines at the <unk> <unk> produced some of the largest amounts of mercury in North America in the 20th century . Public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited . <unk> includes large <unk> of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands . Sage grouse and mountain <unk> are two bird species native to the range , and common mammals include <unk> and jackrabbits . 
 Despite the area 's dry climate , a few year @-@ round streams provide habitat for the rare <unk> <unk> trout . Fish populations in the <unk> Creek Mountains declined throughout much of the 20th century . In the 1980s , the effects of grazing <unk> on riparian zones and the fish led to land @-@ use conflict . The <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group was formed in 1988 to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners , environmentalists , government agencies , and other interested parties . The <unk> met and agreed on changes to land @-@ use practices , and since the early 1990s , riparian zones have begun to recover .

 The <unk> Creek Mountains are in a very remote area of southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada , in Harney and Humboldt counties . The nearest human settlements are the <unk> Ranch , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) directly north from the middle of the mountains ; Fields , Oregon , about 23 miles ( 37 km ) to the northwest ; <unk> , Nevada , about 15 miles ( 24 km ) to the west ; and <unk> , Nevada – Oregon , about 30 miles ( 48 km ) to the east . The mountains are about 150 miles ( 240 km ) directly southwest of Boise , Idaho , and about 190 miles ( 310 km ) northeast of <unk> , Nevada . 
 The range and surrounding non @-@ mountainous areas cover an area of <unk> square miles ( 2 @,@ 100 km2 ) . The mountains run 51 miles ( 82 km ) north to south and 36 miles ( 58 km ) east to west . More of the range is in Oregon ( 78 % ) than in Nevada ( 22 % ) . The highest point in the range is <unk> View <unk> , which is 8 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 593 m ) above sea level and is located in Nevada about one mile south of the Oregon border . About two miles southeast of <unk> View is Disaster Peak , " a large , symmetrical <unk> that is visible throughout the region . " At 7 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 372 m ) , Disaster Peak anchors the southern end of the mountains in a sub @-@ range called The <unk> . 
 The Oregon Canyon Mountains border the <unk> Creek Mountains on the east along the Harney – <unk> county line ( according to the United States Geological Survey 's definitions ) , while the <unk> Mountains are the next range west of the <unk> Creek Mountains . The <unk> Creek Mountains in both Oregon and Nevada border the <unk> Creek Mountains on the southwest ; the two ranges are separated by <unk> Cabin Creek and South Fork <unk> Creek . South of the <unk> Creek Mountains is the Kings River Valley , which separates the <unk> Creek Mountains on the west from the Montana Mountains on the east . 
 The terrain in the <unk> Creek Mountains varies from broad , flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock <unk> cut by deep canyons . The canyons have steep walls with loose <unk> slopes at the <unk> . There are meadows around springs in the mountains , although most streams in the range do not flow year @-@ round . Major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include ( from west to east ) <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , and <unk> Creek . These streams all flow into <unk> basins in Harney County , Oregon . <unk> Creek and <unk> Creek are the largest of the four . The Kings River and <unk> Creek each drain an area on the south slopes of the <unk> Creek Mountains . The Kings River begins in The <unk> and flows south into Nevada , where it meets the Quinn River , which <unk> in the Black Rock Desert . <unk> Creek begins in Oregon a few miles north of The <unk> and flows generally east , crossing the Oregon – Nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the Quinn River Valley south of <unk> .

 The mountains lie within the Basin and Range Province or Great Basin of the Western United States , which is characterized by a series of parallel fault blocks that form long north – south mountain ranges separated by wide , high @-@ desert valleys . The <unk> Creek Mountains are <unk> and <unk> blocks with steep <unk> along the southern and eastern sides of the range . The southern area of the range , known as The <unk> , has numerous <unk> of Cretaceous age granite . These granite <unk> are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic <unk> . 
 The <unk> Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where <unk> Mountain is today . <unk> thinning and the Yellowstone <unk> , which was then beneath southeastern Oregon , induced eruptions from <unk> and nearby <unk> about 17 million years ago , in the Miocene . The <unk> produced a series of <unk> flows that spread across the land now known as the <unk> Creek Mountains . <unk> from the <unk> volcano lasted for about one million years , and at least 70 separate <unk> flows occurred . Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older <unk> rocks that may be related to some of the <unk> age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon . Within these <unk> rocks are <unk> and <unk> <unk> bodies which were presumably <unk> during the Cretaceous Period . 
 The broad <unk> <unk> is a prominent geologic feature in the <unk> Creek Mountains . The oval @-@ shaped <unk> is a collapsed <unk> dome that <unk> the Oregon – Nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains . It is about 28 miles ( 45 km ) long and 22 miles ( 35 km ) wide . The <unk> dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene . A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large <unk> dome structure . The <unk> formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago . The <unk> contains significant ore deposits , and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the <unk> . Other areas in the <unk> were mined for ores of antimony , <unk> , and lithium . 
 
 = = Climate = = 
 
 The <unk> Creek Mountains are semi @-@ arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west . When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range , most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the <unk> Creek Mountains . As a result , the average annual precipitation in the <unk> Creek Mountains is only 8 to 26 inches ( 200 to 660 mm ) per year , with most areas receiving between 8 and 12 inches ( 200 and 300 mm ) annually . Much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of March and the end of June . Most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months . <unk> at elevations below 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) usually <unk> by April ; however , at the higher elevations , snow can remain until mid @-@ June . Local flooding often occurs in the spring as the <unk> <unk> . 
 The prevailing winds are from the west @-@ southwest , and they are normally strongest in March and April . <unk> , intense thunderstorms are common between April and October . <unk> in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes .

 <unk> in the <unk> Creek Mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses . Other common shrubs include <unk> , snowberry , and <unk> . There are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas . Common grass species include Idaho <unk> , bluebunch wheatgrass , <unk> , western <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , as well as basin <unk> in some well @-@ drained areas . 
 Less than one percent of the range consists of meadow wetlands and riparian <unk> ( vegetation along stream banks ) . However , these areas are vital to the local ecosystem . The meadows surround springs , which are mostly on gently sloping <unk> or in stream <unk> , and range in size from about 1 to 5 acres ( 0 @.@ 40 to 2 @.@ 02 ha ) . <unk> riparian <unk> follow the year @-@ round streams . Many <unk> areas have <unk> <unk> and <unk> groves . <unk> and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is <unk> and stream channels are wider . <unk> and rushes are also native to these stream <unk> . Years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species , riparian vegetation , and young <unk> and <unk> trees . Restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s , and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s . However , large <unk> in southeastern Oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range 's vegetation , damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle .

 Animals in the <unk> Creek Mountains are adapted to the environment of the High Desert . <unk> are common in the open , sagebrush @-@ covered basins , while mule deer live in the cottonwood and <unk> groves . There are also <unk> sheep , cougars , and <unk> in the high country . Jackrabbits and coyotes are prevalent throughout the range . Mustangs sometimes pass through the mountains as they <unk> the Great Basin . Some other mammals include the northern pocket <unk> , mountain <unk> , and <unk> 's ground <unk> . North American <unk> live in and along streams , as do Pacific tree frogs , western <unk> toads , and <unk> snakes . Native bird species include the sage grouse , mountain <unk> , gray @-@ headed <unk> , black @-@ throated gray <unk> , Virginia 's <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , pine <unk> , red <unk> , <unk> , <unk> thrush , northern <unk> , and species of <unk> and eagle . 
 Several streams in the <unk> Creek Mountains are home to trout , including the rare <unk> <unk> trout subspecies . These include <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , Little <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , Fifteen Mile Creek , Indian Creek , Sage Canyon Creek , Line Canyon Creek , and some tributaries of <unk> Creek . <unk> <unk> trout live in small , isolated populations that are often confined to individual streams , many of them in the <unk> Creek Mountains . These populations have significant genetic differences due to their history of isolation . For most of the 20th century , the trout 's numbers declined considerably . It was listed under federal law as an endangered species in 1970 and was reclassified as threatened in 1975 . Reasons for the fish 's decline included habitat degradation from cattle grazing , drought , <unk> , competition with other fish , and <unk> with introduced rainbow trout , which decreased the number of genetically pure <unk> <unk> trout . However , reductions in cattle grazing in riparian zones since the 1980s allowed fish habitat and populations to start to recover .

 The Bureau of Land Management ( <unk> ) administers most land in the <unk> Creek Mountains , but there are also some private lands and some roads in the area . The private lands are mainly used for <unk> along mountain streams , while the <unk> lands include large grazing <unk> for local ranchers ' cattle . At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892 , some of which were staked for gold exploration . Commercial mining has occurred in some areas , mostly near the <unk> <unk> , where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted . <unk> in what was called the <unk> <unk> District produced 270 @,@ 000 <unk> of mercury — " the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere " — from <unk> extracted from the <unk> in the 20th century . The two leading mercury @-@ producing mines in North America were the <unk> and <unk> mines on the edge of the <unk> in Nevada . Together , they operated from 1933 to 1989 . The <unk> Mine , the last mercury mine in the United States , closed three years later , in 1992 . However , mineral exploration has continued at the <unk> Mine in the 21st century , and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of <unk> as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <unk> project . 
 The entire mountain range is very remote ; as a result , there are few visitors , and the range offers a wilderness @-@ like experience . <unk> , hunting , fishing , and hiking are the most popular activities . The only developed recreation site nearby is at <unk> Creek Hot Springs , just south of the <unk> Ranch , where nearby there are miles of trails designated for four @-@ wheel off @-@ road vehicles . Hunters come to the mountains seeking trophy mule deer , <unk> , <unk> , and rabbits . <unk> on some streams is sometimes permitted on a catch @-@ and @-@ release basis . The mountains are also suitable for hiking cross @-@ country or on game trails in natural corridors along canyons and creek <unk> . There are more than 100 archaeological sites in the range that document use by Northern <unk> people as long as 7 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 <unk> grazing in the <unk> Creek Mountains began in the late 19th century , and the <unk> currently <unk> grazing <unk> in the area . <unk> can be found grazing in some areas during the spring and summer months . The effects of grazing on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the 1980s . 
 
 = = Land @-@ management compromise = = 
 
 By the 1970s and 1980s , a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the <unk> Creek Mountains and elsewhere in the Great Basin . As a result , stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones . <unk> populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures . These conditions put the rare <unk> <unk> trout population at risk . Since the <unk> was officially designated as a threatened species , environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the <unk> Creek Mountains . 
 Beginning in the early 1970s , the Bureau of Land Management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas . Approximately 20 @,@ 000 <unk> trees were planted along streams , small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams , and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing . Next , the agency sought to reform land @-@ use plans to change grazing practices , which became a complex and controversial project . 
 As environmentalists pressed the <unk> to close much of the <unk> Creek Mountains to grazing , frustrated ranchers joined the <unk> Rebellion seeking to protect their grazing <unk> . Initially , it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged litigation with appeals potentially lasting decades . However , in 1988 , interest groups representing all sides of the issue joined to form the <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group . The group 's goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone — a plan that would protect both the land 's ecological health and ranchers ' economic needs . 
 Initial members of the <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group included : 
 Over the next several years , the group continued to meet and discuss options for restoring the land while meeting the economic needs of local ranchers . Meetings were all open to the public . 
 The group eventually endorsed a grazing management plan that provided for both the ecological health of sensitive riparian areas and the economic well @-@ being of ranchers . In 1989 , the <unk> Ranch agreed to rest two grazing <unk> totaling 50 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 ha ) to restore critical stream <unk> and mountain pastures . The <unk> 's <unk> on Fifteen Mile Creek was rested for three years , and its <unk> Creek pasture received a five @-@ year rest before grazing was resumed . In addition , the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two , and the total number of cattle released in the <unk> areas was reduced from 3 @,@ 800 to 2 @,@ 200 . Finally , sensitive areas were <unk> to protect them from cattle , and additional water sources were constructed away from streams . Other <unk> also agreed to rest specific pastures including the <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , and <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 In 1991 , the Bureau of Land Management approved a new grazing <unk> management plan . It was based on the agreements made by the <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group , and it took effect in 1992 . Since then , vegetation in riparian areas of the <unk> Creek Mountains has recovered , and studies by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service have found that the <unk> <unk> trout population , still listed as threatened , is also recovering .

The cap frequently develops splits in the margin , or cracks in the disc ( the central part of the cap ) . The flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere , grayish to whitish , fragile , and with a slightly <unk> odor and taste . The gills have a <unk> attachment to the stem ( that is , running down the length of the stem ) and are a pale brownish color with <unk> of red . They are broad ( between 3 and 6 mm ) , and have a close to <unk> spacing , with about 26 – 35 gills reaching the stem .

 Mycena <unk> is a saprobic fungus , deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves , twigs , bark and branches . It <unk> this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter : <unk> , <unk> and lignin . 
 The fruit bodies of Mycena <unk> grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps ( especially oak and chestnut ) during the spring and autumn . The fungus forms a white , <unk> mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves . Occasionally , it can be found growing on a living tree . In eastern North America , it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia , Ontario , Manitoba , Missouri , North Carolina , and New York . It has been found in Oregon , but the species appears to be generally rare along the Pacific Coast .

 Capel <unk> ( sometimes referred to as Hen <unk> <unk> ) is a ruined chapel near <unk> <unk> in Anglesey , north Wales , dating back to the first half of the 12th century . The chapel 's original purpose is unknown , but it might have been used as a memorial chapel or in connection with a local royal court , or as a chapel of ease in a large parish with a growing population . It was used for a time until the early 18th century as a private place of worship for a nearby house , then later fell into disrepair . The walls still remain , with some traces of render on them internally , but there is no roof . 
 It contains a 16th @-@ century side chapel with a vault beneath , used as a burial chamber . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " , in particular because it is " a substantially 12th @-@ century structure " with the " unusual 16th @-@ century vaulted south chapel " .

 The oldest parts of Capel <unk> date from the first half of the 12th century . This was a time when many churches on Anglesey in north @-@ west Wales were first built in stone following the end of Viking raids and attempts by the <unk> to gain control of the island . The reason for its construction , and the saint to whom it was dedicated , are unknown . Geraint Jones , author of a 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey , suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel , or connected to a royal court nearby . <unk> and <unk> , authors of a 2001 guide to ancient Anglesey monuments , note that it was built in the large parish of <unk> <unk> and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times . Despite this , it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right . The chapel is sometimes referred to as " Hen <unk> <unk> " ( " hen " being the Welsh word for " old " and " <unk> " meaning " chapel " ) . 
 The walls were partially rebuilt in the 14th century , and the upper parts of the walls date from this time . A chapel was added to the south side of the building in the 16th century . A vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family , the Pierce <unk> . In 1999 , the vault was used to record some " atmospheres " for the album " You Have Just Been <unk> By The <unk> " by The <unk> , a collective of Welsh musicians including members of Echo and the <unk> , Super <unk> Animals and <unk> that was described by one journalist as " possibly the <unk> pop group of all time " . 
 For a time , Capel <unk> was used as a private place of worship for <unk> House , a " venerable mansion " once owned by the Lloyd family which came into the possession of William <unk> , 1st Baron Boston , in the 18th century . After the early part of the 18th century , however , the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair . The walls remain to gable level , with some traces of render on the inside , but the roof has gone . 
 Capel <unk> is in the Anglesey countryside near <unk> ; the parish church of St <unk> , <unk> is about 0 @.@ 78 miles ( 1 @.@ 26 km ) away . Part of the churchyard wall remains , showing that it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure , as often found with early churches . It is cared for by Cadw , the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales , and is open to the public .

There is no structural division between the nave ( where the congregation would have sat ) and the chancel ( where the altar would have been located ) . There are no window openings on the north side , but there is a blocked opening to the east ( about 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) wide ) and there are the remains of a window on the south wall . There is a blocked window in the south wall of the south chapel . The vault , which is about 27 square feet ( 2 @.@ 5 m2 ) , is reached by stone steps from inside the south chapel . <unk> slabs form the roof of the vault and the floor of the chapel above .

 Capel <unk> has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building – the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " . It was given this status on 2 September 1952 and has been listed because it is " important as a substantially 12th @-@ century structure , with some architectural details surviving from this early period " , even though it is now in a " ruinous condition " . Cadw ( which is responsible for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes the " unusual 16th @-@ century vaulted south chapel " . 
 The 19th @-@ century antiquarian <unk> <unk> mentioned the church in her history of Anglesey . She said that the architecture was of " the <unk> kind , [ which ] bears testimony to its great antiquity . " She recounted that a fox had once taken shelter in the ruins , and when it was dug out , the vault was discovered , " containing several human skeletons , which <unk> into dust , when exposed to the air " . She added that further exploration of the vault then revealed " a large mass of human bones , several feet in depth " . 
 A 1990 book about abandoned churches in Wales refers to the ancient monuments in this part of Anglesey , and calls Capel <unk> a " medieval gesture of Christian power in a land so obviously <unk> with the spirit of a pagan past " . It notes that " the wheel has turned full circle and Capel <unk> today is just another ruined relic of a former age . " The authors describe the chapel as a " simple , square building " with a " small and <unk> austere south chapel " , adding that the stone slabs over the vault are " almost in imitation of the ancient burial chambers which dot the surrounding landscape .

 <unk> <unk> b ( abbreviated <unk> <unk> b , <unk> And b ) , occasionally designated <unk> <unk> <unk> ( to distinguish it from the red dwarf <unk> <unk> B ) , also named <unk> , is an extrasolar planet approximately 44 light @-@ years away from the Sun in the constellation of <unk> . The planet orbits the Solar twin star , <unk> <unk> A , approximately every five days . Discovered in June 1996 by Geoffrey <unk> and R. Paul Butler , it was one of the first hot Jupiters to be discovered . It is also one of the first non @-@ resolved planets to be detected directly . <unk> <unk> b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system . 
 In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars . The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names . In December 2015 , the IAU announced the winning name was <unk> for this planet . The winning name was submitted by the Vega <unk> Club of Morocco and honours the 11th Century astronomer Ibn al @-@ <unk> of Muslim Spain . 
 
 = = Discovery = = 
 
 Like the majority of known extrasolar planets , <unk> <unk> b was detected by the variations in its star 's radial velocity caused by the planet 's gravity . The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the <unk> shift of <unk> <unk> 's spectrum . The planet 's existence was announced in January 1997 , together with 55 <unk> b and the planet orbiting <unk> <unk> . 
 Like 51 <unk> b , the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star , <unk> <unk> b orbits very close to its star , closer than Mercury does to our Sun . The planet takes 4 @.@ <unk> days to complete an orbit , with a <unk> axis of 0 @.@ <unk> AU . 
 A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect <unk> <unk> b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found . In the case of <unk> <unk> b , this lower limit is 68 @.@ 7 % of the mass of Jupiter , though depending on the inclination of the orbit , the true mass may be much greater . However , astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around 25 ° and the true mass may be about 1 @.@ 4 MJ . <unk> is not to be assumed ; the mutual inclination between c and d is 35 degrees . 
 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 
 Given the planet 's high mass , it is likely that <unk> <unk> b is a gas giant with no solid surface . 
 The <unk> Space Telescope measured the planet temperature , and found that the difference between the two sides of <unk> <unk> b of about 1 @,@ 400 degrees <unk> , ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1 @,@ 400 to 1 @,@ 650 degrees <unk> . The temperature difference has led to speculation that <unk> <unk> b is <unk> locked with the same side always facing <unk> <unk> A. 
 <unk> had , on the assumption that the planet is similar to Jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium , predicted <unk> <unk> b to have reflective clouds of <unk> and iron in its upper atmosphere . The cloud deck instead absorbs the sun 's radiation ; between that and the hot , high pressure gas surrounding the mantle , exists a <unk> of cooler gas . The outer shell of dark , <unk> , hot cloud is assumed to consist of <unk> and <unk> oxides ( " <unk> planets " ) , but other compounds like <unk> cannot be ruled out yet . 
 The planet is unlikely to have large moons , since <unk> forces would either <unk> them from orbit or destroy them on short <unk> compared to the age of the system . 
 The planet ( with 51 <unk> b ) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by <unk> . Preliminary results from <unk> studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color , is 1 @.@ 36 times as large and 0 @.@ 74 times as massive as Jupiter , meaning that the mean density is <unk> / cm3 . It has a <unk> albedo of 0 @.@ 35 in visible light . 
 
 = = <unk> on its sun = = 
 
 <unk> <unk> b appears to be responsible for increased <unk> activity on its parent star . Observations suggest that there is a " hot spot " on the star around 169 ° away from the sub @-@ planetary point . This may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star . The mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of <unk> <unk> <unk> variable stars , or the interaction between Jupiter and its moon Io .

 Daniel Jacob <unk> ( born 23 July 1989 ) is an English actor who rose to prominence as the title character in the Harry Potter film series . He made his acting debut at 10 years of age in BBC One 's 1999 television film David Copperfield , followed by his cinematic debut in 2001 's The <unk> of Panama . At age 11 , he was cast as Harry Potter in the first Harry Potter film , and starred in the series for 10 years until the release of the eighth and final film in 2011 .

He starred in the 2012 horror film The Woman in Black , and played beat poet Allen Ginsberg in the 2013 independent film Kill Your <unk> . 
 He has contributed to many charities , including <unk> Hospice Care for Children , and The Trevor Project for suicide prevention among <unk> youth , which gave him its Hero Award in 2011 .

 <unk> was born in West London , England . He is the only child of Alan George <unk> , a literary agent , and Marcia <unk> <unk> ( née Marcia <unk> Jacobson ) , a casting agent who was involved in several films for the BBC , including The Inspector <unk> Mysteries and Walk Away and I <unk> . His father , who was raised in <unk> , County Down , Northern Ireland , is from " a very working @-@ class " Protestant background . His mother is Jewish , and was born in South Africa and raised in <unk> @-@ on @-@ Sea , Essex . Her family had originally come from Poland and Russia . <unk> 's parents had both acted as children . 
 In a 2012 interview , <unk> stated : " There was never [ religious ] faith in the house . I think of myself as being Jewish and Irish , despite the fact that I 'm English . " He has stated : " We were Christmas tree Jews " , and that he is " very proud of being Jewish " . 
 <unk> first expressed a desire to act at the age of five , and in December 1999 , aged 10 , he made his acting debut in BBC One 's televised two @-@ part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield , portraying the title character as a young boy . He was educated at two independent schools for boys : Sussex House School , a day school in Chelsea 's <unk> Square , and the City of London School , a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London 's financial district ( known as the City of London ) . <unk> school became difficult for <unk> after the release of the first Harry Potter film , with some fellow pupils becoming hostile , though he says it was people just trying to " have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter " rather than jealousy . 
 As his acting career began to consume his schedule , <unk> continued his education through on @-@ set tutors . He admitted he was not very good at school , considering it useless and finding the work " really difficult . " He achieved A grades in the three <unk> @-@ level exams that he took in 2006 , but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university . Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write , and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience . " The <unk> , they 'd love it , " he told Details magazine in 2007 . " If there were any parties going on , they 'd be tipped off as to where they were . "

 In 2000 , producer David <unk> asked <unk> to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the <unk> 's Stone , the best @-@ selling book by British author J. K. <unk> . <unk> had been searching for an unknown British actor to <unk> the character , and the movie 's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking , " This is what I want . This is Harry Potter " , after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield . Eight months later , and after several auditions , <unk> was selected to play the part . <unk> also endorsed the selection saying , " I don 't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry . " <unk> 's parents originally turned down the offer , as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles . Warner Bros. instead offered <unk> a two @-@ movie contract with shooting in the UK ; <unk> was unsure at the time if he would do any more than that . 
 The release of Harry Potter and the <unk> 's Stone ( released as Harry Potter and the <unk> 's Stone in the United States ) took place in 2001 . <unk> received a seven figure salary for the lead role , but asserted that the fee was " not that important " to him ; his parents chose to invest the money for him . The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews , and critics took notice of <unk> : " <unk> is the embodiment of every reader 's imagination . It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions , from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing , " wrote Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle . 
 A year later <unk> starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of <unk> , the second installment of the series . Reviewers were positive about the lead actors ' performances but had <unk> opinions on the movie as a whole . The 2004 release Harry Potter and the <unk> of <unk> was the third film in the series . <unk> 's performance was panned by New York Times journalist A. O.

His performance earned several award nominations , and he received the 2008 National Movie Award for " Best Male Performance . " As his fame and the series continued , <unk> , <unk> , and Watson left <unk> of their hands , feet , and <unk> in front of <unk> 's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood . In July 2009 Harry Potter and the Half @-@ Blood Prince was released , the series ' sixth instalment . <unk> received nominations for " Best Male Performance " and " Global <unk> " at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards . 
 For financial and <unk> reasons the last book was divided into two films , shot back to back , which drew criticism from the series ' fanbase . <unk> defended the split , stating that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film . He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast @-@ paced with a lot of action , while the first part would be far more <unk> , focusing on character development ; he added that , had they combined them , those things would not have made it to the final cut . Filming lasted for a year , concluding in June 2010 and on the last day of shooting , like most of the cast and crew , <unk> openly <unk> . 
 The final film , Harry Potter and the <unk> <unk> – Part 2 , was released in July 2011 . <unk> , along with the film , was critically acclaimed : Ann <unk> of The Washington Post asked , " Who could have predicted that <unk> , <unk> and Watson would turn out to be good actors ? " ; similarly , Rex Reed said : " <unk> , I ’ m sorry to see [ <unk> ] go " ; while Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers commented on <unk> : " Well played , sir . " Roger <unk> gave the film a highly positive review , but felt that <unk> , <unk> and Watson were " upstaged by the supporting [ actors ] . " 
 <unk> admitted that some people would never be able to separate him from the character , but also said he is " proud to be associated with this film series forever . " Despite positive feelings about the movies , he has no interest in doing more Harry Potter films . After <unk> hinted about writing an eighth book , <unk> was asked if he would do another film to which he replied : " [ It is ] very doubtful . I think 10 years is a long time to spend with one character . " Despite <unk> so much time to the series , <unk> has asserted that he did not miss out on a childhood like other child actors : " I ’ ve been given a much better perspective on life by doing Potter .

 The episode features guest appearances by the members of the band Kiss — Peter Criss , Ace <unk> , Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley — who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role . However , the band members insisted during filming that their roles be given an equal amount of dialogue , which led to Perry being asked to amend scenes on short notice and <unk> updated scripts to the shooting locations ; ultimately much of this additional material was filmed but not used in the episode . Ace <unk> was also <unk> towards his role , and requested to play a " 300 @-@ pound black man " instead , wishing to wear a fat suit like those used in the 1996 Eddie Murphy film The <unk> Professor ; he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to <unk> . 
 Perry has described the production " ... Thirteen Years Later " as being " one of the most <unk> " of the series ' run , citing its abundance of stunt work and physical effects as the cause of this . Perry praised Wright for his ability to direct the episode within the usual time constraints , as he felt the number of shots involved was more akin to a feature film than a television episode . Guest star Jeff <unk> , who played killer Mark Bianco , is the husband of actress Megan Gallagher , who starred in the first two seasons of Millennium as Black 's wife Catherine .

This represented approximately 5 @.@ 37 million households . 
 " ... Thirteen Years Later " received mixed reviews from critics . The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a " B " . VanDerWerff felt that the episode 's comedic <unk> was necessary within the wider series , as he considered Millennium 's dark tone to be prone to unintentional comedy and that a comic episode provided an outlet for this . VanDerWerff found the script to be at its strongest when <unk> the character of Frank Black , but admitted that it " falls apart " when attempting to send up other subjects ; he also felt that the guest appearance by Kiss felt unnecessary and contrived . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated " ... Thirteen Years Later " one star out of five . Shearman felt that the episode had the potential to be much better , but that " the whole concept drowns in <unk> " . He considered the episode 's characters to too shallow and its commentary to be too heavy @-@ handed to fully execute anything meaningful ; criticism was also levelled at the guest roles by the members of Kiss .

Between the southern terminus and I @-@ 95 , the route is a mix of freeway and four @-@ lane divided highway that runs along the Delaware River through <unk> . This section includes a truck @-@ restricted tunnel that was built along the river near historic houses and <unk> Cemetery . North of I @-@ 95 , Route 29 turns into a scenic and mostly two @-@ lane highway . North of the South <unk> Tunnel , it is designated the Delaware River Scenic Byway , a New Jersey Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway , that follows the Delaware River in mostly rural sections of Mercer County and <unk> County . The obsolete Delaware & <unk> Canal usually stands between the river and the highway . Most sections of this portion of Route 29 are completely <unk> due to the tree canopy . Route 29 also has a spur , Route 129 , which connects Route 29 to U.S. Route 1 ( US 1 ) in <unk> . 
 Route 29 was initially designated in 1927 to run from downtown <unk> to Newark , following present @-@ day Route 179 and US 202 between <unk> and <unk> and US 22 between <unk> and Newark . The route between <unk> and Frenchtown was originally Route <unk> . In 1953 , Route 29 was shifted to follow the alignment of Route <unk> to avoid the <unk> with the U.S. Routes . Route 29 between South Warren Street in <unk> and I @-@ 95 in Ewing Township was upgraded to a four @-@ lane highway , with a portion of freeway , in the 1950s and 1960s . In 1995 , the southern freeway part of Route 29 between I @-@ 195 / I @-@ 295 and Route 129 in Hamilton Township was completed . This freeway section was linked to the rest of Route 29 by a tunnel completed in 2002 . A realignment of Route 29 in <unk> by the 2000s made the route concurrent with the entire length of 0 @.@ 26 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 0 @.@ 42 km ) Route 165 .

 = = History = = 
 
 The current route was originally legislated in 1911 as part of the Delaware River Drive , a named state highway that was proposed to run from along the Delaware River from <unk> to the New York border in <unk> Township . Route 29 was originally defined in 1927 to run from <unk> to Newark . The original route ran from downtown <unk> along State Street and <unk> Drive . From there , it followed its current alignment to <unk> , where it followed present @-@ day Route 179 to <unk> to present @-@ day County Route <unk> , which it followed to Woods Tavern . The route turned north on U.S. Route 206 ( also designated Route 31 ) and followed that route to <unk> , where it followed U.S. Route 22 to Newark . The current alignment of Route 29 from <unk> to Route 12 in Frenchtown was designated Route <unk> in 1927 . 
 The alignment of Route 29 between <unk> and <unk> was eventually shifted to follow present @-@ day U.S. Route 202 , which was also Route 30 ( now Route 31 ) between <unk> and Flemington and Route 12 between Flemington and <unk> . In 1938 , Route <unk> was planned as an extension of Route <unk> from Frenchtown to Route 28 ( now Route 122 ) in Alpha . While this road was never built , much of the alignment north of Milford is served by County Route <unk> . In 1948 , a spur route , Route <unk> , was created , running along U.S. Route 202 ( Bridge Street ) in <unk> to the New Hope @-@ <unk> Bridge . In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 29 was <unk> to continue north from <unk> to Frenchtown on Route <unk> , and the Route 29 designation between <unk> and Newark was removed in favor of U.S. Route 202 between <unk> and <unk> and U.S. Route 22 between <unk> and Newark . The section of former Route 29 between Route <unk> and Route <unk> became Route 165 . 
 Plans for a limited @-@ access route along the Route 29 corridor go back to 1932 , when a parkway was proposed along the Delaware River between <unk> and <unk> ; this proposal never materialized . Plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950s to construct a road , the John Fitch Parkway , that was to run from Hamilton Township to Interstate 95 in Ewing Township . This road was built between 1954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in <unk> to present @-@ day Interstate 95 in Ewing Township . Construction of this portion John Fitch Parkway took up much of <unk> ’ s available waterfront along the Delaware River . The former alignment of Route 29 in the northern part of <unk> and in Ewing Township became Route 175 . 
 Between 1990 and 1995 , the Route 29 freeway was built between the Interstate 195 / Interstate 295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township . A two @-@ lane street , <unk> Road , connected the two freeway sections . Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in <unk> . Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the <unk> @-@ <unk> Railroad Bridge . The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River . The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel . The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2 , 2002 . A restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002 . 
 By the 2000s , the state gave the part of Route 29 ( South Main Street ) between Route 165 and Route 179 in <unk> to the city , and Route 29 was rerouted to use all of Route 165 and one block of Route 179 . Prior to this , South Main Street had been turned one @-@ way southbound . Route 165 , which is only signed on overhead street signs , still exists , though it is fully concurrent with Route 29 .

 = First <unk> invasion of Burma = 
 
 The first <unk> invasions of Burma ( <unk> ) ( <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> – <unk> ) ) were a series of military conflicts between <unk> Khan 's Yuan dynasty , division of the <unk> Empire , and the Pagan Empire that took place between <unk> and <unk> . The invasions toppled the 250 @-@ year @-@ old Pagan Empire , and the <unk> army seized Pagan territories in present @-@ day <unk> , <unk> and northern Burma to <unk> . The invasions <unk> in 250 years of political fragmentation in Burma and the rise of Tai @-@ Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia . 
 The Mongols first demanded tribute from Pagan in 1271 – 72 , as part of their drive to encircle the Song dynasty of China . When King <unk> refused , Emperor <unk> Khan himself sent another mission in <unk> , again demanding tribute . It too was rejected . In 1275 , the emperor ordered the <unk> government to secure the <unk> in order to block an escape path for the Song , and permitted a limited border war if Pagan contested . Pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the <unk> Army in <unk> – 78 . After a brief lull , <unk> Khan in 1281 turned his attention to Southeast Asia , demanding tribute from Pagan , the Khmer Empire , <unk> <unk> and <unk> . When the <unk> king again refused , the emperor ordered an invasion of northern Burma . Two dry season campaigns ( <unk> – 85 ) later , the Mongols had occupied down to <unk> and <unk> , forcing the <unk> king to flee to Lower Burma . The Mongols organized northern Burma as the province of <unk> . 
 <unk> negotiations began in <unk> , and ended with <unk> finally agreeing to submit in June <unk> . The <unk> embassy , received by the emperor in Beijing in January <unk> , agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the <unk> of the Yuan dynasty or the <unk> Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the <unk> government in exchange for the evacuation of <unk> troops from northern Burma . But the treaty never really took effect as <unk> was assassinated in July <unk> , and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged . The <unk> command at <unk> now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void , and ordered an invasion of central Burma . They may not have reached Pagan , and even if they did , after having suffered heavy casualties , they returned to <unk> . 
 The Pagan Empire <unk> and anarchy ensued . The Mongols , who probably preferred the situation , did nothing to restore order in the next ten years . In March <unk> , they accepted the voluntary submission of King <unk> of Pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of Pagan ( <unk> ) . But <unk> was overthrown nine months later , and the Mongols were forced to intervene , leading to their second invasion in 1300 – 01 . 
 Marco Polo reported the first invasions ( <unk> – 87 ) in his <unk> , Il <unk> . The <unk> referred to the invaders as the <unk> ( after the central Asian <unk> troops that largely made up the <unk> invasion army ) ; today , the term <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) refers to the Han Chinese instead . King <unk> is <unk> remembered in <unk> history as <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> , ( " the King who <unk> from the <unk> " ) .

 In the 13th century , the Pagan Empire , along with the Khmer Empire , was one of the two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia . For much of its history , Pagan 's neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent <unk> Kingdom and its predecessor <unk> , both with <unk> as their capital city . <unk> @-@ based kingdoms were a power in their own right , at times <unk> themselves with the <unk> Empire to their west and at other times with China 's Tang and Song dynasties . Indeed , <unk> 's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself . 
 Between the newly conquered <unk> territory and Pagan were a wide <unk> of <unk> stretching from present @-@ day <unk> , <unk> and <unk> prefectures in <unk> as well as the <unk> and <unk> regions ( presumably in present @-@ day northern Shan State ) , which Pagan and <unk> had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence . Then as now , the <unk> mostly consist of <unk> <unk> of high mountain ranges .

 The <unk> Empire first arrived at the <unk> of the Pagan Empire in <unk> by invading the <unk> Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China . The <unk> armies captured the capital , <unk> , on 7 January <unk> , and went on to <unk> much of the kingdom by <unk> . 
 The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the <unk> as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song . For the next dozen years , they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land , which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India . The Mongols set up military garrisons , manned mostly by <unk> @-@ speaking Muslims from Central Asia , in 37 circuits of the former <unk> Kingdom . 
 
 = = = Decline of Pagan = = = 
 
 By then , the Pagan Empire , despite outward appearances of calm , had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century . The continuous growth of tax @-@ free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom . The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen , inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges . Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in <unk> – 60 in South <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) , the decline continued . On the eve of the <unk> invasions , between one and two @-@ thirds of Upper Burma 's <unk> land had been donated to religion . The crown 's ability to <unk> defenses was in serious jeopardy .

 The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early <unk> . By then , the Song were on the ropes , and Emperor <unk> Khan , who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271 , sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions . In Pagan 's case , he had ordered the <unk> governor of <unk> to <unk> control of the <unk> , and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute . The tribute he demanded was nominal . Given his higher priority <unk> elsewhere , the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan . At the border , the ruler of the <unk> and <unk> regions submitted to the Mongols . 
 When the <unk> envoys led by <unk> <unk> showed up , the Pagan court led by Chief Minister <unk> <unk> was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King <unk> to use diplomacy . The king was furious at the demand and kept the <unk> envoys waiting for weeks . The court finally devised a compromise : the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king . <unk> them was a <unk> envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the <unk> king 's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing . The king then promptly ordered an expedition , which retook the rebellious <unk> regions in April <unk> . The rebel leader A @-@ <unk> ( <unk> ) was brought back to Pagan . <unk> relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action .

 At Beijing , <unk> Khan , who was preparing an invasion of Japan , decided against a war with Pagan — for the time being . On 3 March <unk> , he sent a 4 @-@ member delegation led by an imperial ambassador , the First Secretary to the Board <unk> , to Pagan . The delegation carried a letter from the emperor . The letter says : 
 " If you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the All @-@ Highest , send one of your brothers or senior ministers , to show men that all the world is linked with Us , and enter into a perpetual alliance . This will add to your reputation , and be in your own interests ; for if it comes to war , who will be the victor ? <unk> well , O king , Our words . " 
 This time , the <unk> king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit . ( The <unk> chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed . But both <unk> <unk> evidence and Yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed . ) At any rate , the imperial envoys did not get back to <unk> in due time . The newly formed <unk> government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation , but the delegation could not reach Pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route . 
 
 = = = <unk> consolidation of <unk> ( 1275 – 76 ) = = = 
 
 Meanwhile , in <unk> , the former <unk> Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> al @-@ Din Omar as governor . In May 1275 , the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned ; that the <unk> evidently had no intention of submitting ; and that war was the only way forward . 
 But the emperor rejected an outright invasion . Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign , the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair . He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song ; the emperor ordered the <unk> provincial army to secure the <unk> in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees . He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover . As planned , the <unk> army proceeded to consolidate the <unk> in 1275 – 76 . ( Elsewhere , the main <unk> armies had captured most of the Song territory by <unk> . ) 
 By <unk> , at least one <unk> vassal state named " Gold <unk> " ( modern <unk> ) had submitted to the Mongols . Like in <unk> , the <unk> government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state ; but unlike in <unk> , the Mongols had posted a sizable garrison there . Though it was ultimately under <unk> command , many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were <unk> @-@ speaking peoples or people from the further west : Turks from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , but also captive soldiers from the Persian <unk> empire , the <unk> , and even <unk> from the lower <unk> .

 What followed was a border war in <unk> – 78 . It was reported mainly in the Yuan dynasty chronicle and the <unk> of Marco Polo . Although the <unk> chronicles have no record of the border war , a <unk> <unk> inscription mentions the army 's defeat at <unk> . The <unk> accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate .

 According to the Yuan dynasty chronicle and Marco Polo 's accounts , a <unk> army " invaded " the <unk> territory of Gold <unk> , and was defeated by the <unk> army in April <unk> . The battle took place either at the <unk> valley ( in present @-@ day <unk> Prefecture ) or 110 km southwest at <unk> ( present @-@ day <unk> , <unk> Prefecture ) , which the <unk> called <unk> . 
 The Yuan Chronicle reports that only 700 men defeated a <unk> army of 40 @,@ 000 to 50 @,@ 000 with 10 @,@ 000 horses and 800 <unk> . It also reports only one <unk> was killed , in trying to catch an elephant . According to Marco Polo , the <unk> army consisted of 12 @,@ 000 mounted <unk> , and the <unk> army numbered 60 @,@ 000 men with 2000 <unk> , " on each of which was set a tower of timber , well @-@ framed and strong , and carrying from 12 to 16 well @-@ armed fighting men . " Even then , the 40 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 figures of the <unk> army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high ; the Mongols may have <unk> " on the side of generosity " not to " <unk> their glory in defeating superior numbers . " 
 According to Marco Polo 's account , in the early stages of the battle , the Turkish and <unk> horsemen " took such <unk> at the sight of the <unk> that they would not be got to face the <unk> , but always <unk> and turned back , " while the <unk> forces pressed on . But the <unk> commander <unk> did not panic ; he ordered his troops to <unk> , and from the cover of the nearby <unk> , aim their bows directly at the advancing <unk> . The <unk> <unk> ' arrows threw the animals into such pain that they fled .

 The <unk> army pressed on after the monsoon season . In the following dry season of <unk> – 78 , c .

They occupied the fort and destroyed a large number of abandoned <unk> . But they found the heat excessive and returned .

 Despite the <unk> military success , the control of the <unk> remained contested . Pagan did not relinquish its claim to the frontier regions , and the <unk> , apparently taking advantage of <unk> <unk> elsewhere , rebuilt their forts at <unk> and <unk> later in <unk> , posting permanent garrisons commanded by <unk> <unk> . But their control was short @-@ lived . The Great Khan 's attention turned to Southeast Asia once more in 1281 . He had had mixed success : his <unk> forces had finished off the last of the Song in 1279 but had again failed to take Japan in 1281 . That year , the <unk> emperor sent another mission to Pagan , demanding tribute yet again . The <unk> king was to send his ten senior ministers accompanied by one thousand cavalry officers to the emperor 's court . ( With <unk> , the emperor summoned the king of <unk> himself to Beijing . ) 
 At Pagan , <unk> <unk> with his court for an appropriate response but ultimately refused to submit . The <unk> court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of northern Burma . ( He also ordered an invasion of <unk> , whose king too had refused to submit . ) The <unk> king 's troubles did not go <unk> elsewhere in the kingdom . In the same year , a <unk> named <unk> seized the southern port city of <unk> ( <unk> ) by killing its Pagan @-@ appointed governor . Although the king 's three sons were <unk> of the nearby Lower Burma cities ( in <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ) , the king , preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north , did not ( or could not ) take any action on <unk> . 
 Throughout <unk> , the <unk> command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of <unk> and northern Burma . The objective of the Burma campaign was to take over northern Burma but no further ; the emperor did not <unk> an attack on Pagan itself . At least one army consisted of 14 @,@ 000 men of the <unk> Persian <unk> Empire under the command of <unk> <unk> was sent to <unk> to reinforce the Burma invasion force , which again was made up of Turks and other central <unk> . On the <unk> side , the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals , he probably could not have raised a large one . By mid @-@ <unk> , a <unk> army led by generals <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> was deployed at a fort at <unk> .

They took the ancient <unk> capital of <unk> , about 380 km north of Pagan on 5 February <unk> . There , the invaders paused their advance . They found the heat of the searing <unk> valley excessive , and evacuated <unk> , allowing the <unk> to return to <unk> on 10 May <unk> . But the <unk> army renewed their offensive in the following dry season . They retook <unk> , and defeated another <unk> stand south of <unk> , probably near <unk> , on 26 January <unk> , opening the way to Pagan , about 270 km south . After the defeat , the king <unk> , and fled to Lower Burma . The evacuation proved premature . The <unk> forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan . 
 The country fell into chaos . In Lower Burma , the king found himself isolated , let alone plan a counterattack . Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) , the king did not trust any of them , and he and his court settled at <unk> , west of <unk> . Without the full support of his sons , the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one . The governor of <unk> <unk> that same year . The king managed to send two small expeditions to <unk> but they both failed . Now , the entire eastern half of Lower Burma ( <unk> and <unk> ) was in open revolt .

 Given his precarious position , <unk> decided to buy time , and sue for peace with the Mongols . In November / December <unk> , the king ordered his generals <unk> <unk> and <unk> Bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations . The <unk> commanders at <unk> , who had organized northern Burma as a protectorate named <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; Wade – Giles : <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission . They repeated their 1281 demand that the <unk> king send a formal delegation to the emperor . The two sides had reached a tentative agreement by 3 March <unk> , which calls for a full submission of the Pagan Empire , and central Burma to be organized as the province of <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; Wade – Giles : <unk> @-@ Chung ) . After a long <unk> , the king agreed to submit but wanted the <unk> troops to withdraw . In June <unk> , he sent an embassy led by Shin <unk> <unk> , a learned monk , to the emperor 's court .

 In January <unk> , the embassy arrived at Beijing , and was received by the Yuan emperor . The <unk> delegation formally acknowledged <unk> <unk> of their kingdom , and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country . ( Indeed , the tribute was no longer nominal . ) In exchange , the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops . For the emperor , the Burma campaign was the only bright spot ; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly . He did not want to invest more troops <unk> the rest of the kingdom . He preferred a vassal ruler . The <unk> embassy arrived back at <unk> in May <unk> , and reported the terms to the king .

 But the agreement broke down a month later . In late June , the defeated king and his small retinue left their temporary capital for Pagan . But on 1 July <unk> , the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son <unk> , the Viceroy of <unk> . Anarchy ensued . Each region in the country which had not <unk> broke away . No successor to <unk> , who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of Beijing , emerged . Indeed , a king would not emerge until May <unk> . 
 
 = = <unk> intervention ( <unk> ) = = 
 
 Given the chaos , the governor of <unk> ignored the imperial orders of evacuation . The <unk> army commanded by Prince <unk> @-@ sin <unk> , a grandson of the emperor , marched south toward Pagan . According to mainstream traditional ( British colonial era ) scholarship , the <unk> army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate ; fought its way down to Pagan with the loss of 7000 men ; occupied the city ; and sent out <unk> to receive homage , one of which reached south of <unk> . But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary <unk> / Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary <unk> of the conquest . 
 Recent research shows that the <unk> forces most probably never reached Pagan . They were held at bay by the <unk> defenses led by commanders <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and probably never got closer than 160 km north of Pagan . ( An inscription dated 16 February <unk> by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the <unk> army . ) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan , the damage they inflicted was probably minimal . At any rate , the <unk> army suffered heavy casualties , and retreated north to <unk> . They remained there as the treaty was now void . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 The disintegration of the Pagan Empire was now complete . But the Mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created . They would send no more expeditions to restore order . The emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to <unk> the fragmented country . Indeed , his real aim all along may have been " to keep the entire region of Southeast Asia broken and fragmented . " It would be another two years until one of <unk> 's sons , <unk> , emerged as king of Pagan in May <unk> . But the new " king " controlled just a small area around the capital , and had no real army . The real power in central Burma now rested with the three commander brothers . 
 The uneasy arrangement would persist until <unk> . The Mongols continued to occupy northern Burma to <unk> as the province of <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) but ended the fictional central Burma province of <unk> on 18 August <unk> . Meanwhile , the power struggle in central Burma continued with the three brothers <unk> consolidating support . To check their rising power , <unk> submitted to the Mongols in January <unk> , and was recognized by the Yuan emperor <unk> Khan as King of Pagan on 20 March <unk> . The emperor also gave Chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of <unk> . The brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power . On 17 December <unk> , the three brothers <unk> <unk> , and founded the <unk> Kingdom . The <unk> forced the <unk> government to intervene again , leading to the second <unk> invasion of Burma ( 1300 – 01 ) . The invasion failed . Two years later , on 4 April <unk> , the Mongols abolished the province of <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , evacuated <unk> , and returned to <unk> .

 The war was one of several near simultaneous wars <unk> by the <unk> Empire and the Yuan dynasty in the late 13th century . Though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the Mongols , the war set off a series of enduring developments in Burma . The invasions <unk> in a period of political fragmentation , and the rise of Tai @-@ Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia . 
 
 = = = Age of political fragmentation = = = 
 
 The immediate result of the war was the collapse of the Pagan Empire . However , the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it . Pagan 's disintegration was " in fact more prolonged and <unk> . " The kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early 13th century . Had Pagan possessed a stronger central government , the collapse could have been temporary , and the country “ could have risen again ” . But the dynasty could not recover , and because the Mongols refused to fill the power vacuum , no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath . As a result , several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the 14th century . It was only in the late 14th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the <unk> basin , restoring some semblance of normalcy . The vast region surrounding the <unk> valley would continue to be made up of several small Tai @-@ Shan states well into the 16th century . 
 
 = = = Rise of Tai @-@ Shan states = = = 
 
 Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the <unk> invasions was the emergence of Tai @-@ Shan states in mainland Southeast Asia . The Tai @-@ Shan people who came down with the <unk> invasions stayed . By the early 14th century , several Tai @-@ Shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present @-@ day <unk> to northern and eastern <unk> to northern and central Thailand and Laos . Their rise was encouraged by the Mongols , who viewed the states as a useful <unk> between <unk> and the rest of Southeast Asia . The Mongols , who were still trying to incorporate <unk> into the central administration , were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of <unk> into the fold . ( The integration of <unk> itself into “ China <unk> ” was to take several more centuries , and continues to today . ) As such , from the newly formed Tai @-@ Shan states in western and central Southeast Asia to Dai Viet and <unk> in eastern Southeast Asia , the Mongols elected to receive nominal tribute . Though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the Yuan government , they were the native chieftains , “ who would have ruled there in any case , and they did as they pleased . ”

 The war also marked the arrival of China at the <unk> of Burma . The old <unk> Kingdom , known to the <unk> as <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , after <unk> Raj ) was now a <unk> Chinese province .

Today , King <unk> is remembered as <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> , ( " the King who fled from the <unk> [ Chinese ] ) . ) From a <unk> standpoint , the <unk> – Chinese presence in <unk> pushed the Shan migrations in the direction of Burma ( and parts of the Khmer Empire ) . The raids by various Shan states into Upper Burma would continue until the mid @-@ 16th century .

 The Battle of <unk> 's Ridge , also known as the Battle of the Bloody Ridge , Battle of Raiders Ridge , and Battle of the Ridge , was a land battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II between Imperial Japanese Army and Allied ( mainly United States Marine Corps ) ground forces . It took place from 12 – 14 September 1942 , on <unk> in the Solomon Islands , and was the second of three separate major Japanese ground offensives during the <unk> Campaign . 
 In the battle , U.S. Marines , under the overall command of U.S. Major General Alexander <unk> , repulsed an attack by the Japanese 35th Infantry Brigade , under the command of Japanese Major General <unk> <unk> . The Marines were defending the <unk> perimeter that guarded Henderson Field on <unk> , which was captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on <unk> on 7 August 1942 . <unk> 's unit was sent to <unk> in response to the Allied landings with the mission of <unk> the airfield and driving the Allied forces from the island . 
 <unk> the strength of Allied forces on <unk> – about 12 @,@ 000 – <unk> 's 6 @,@ 000 soldiers conducted several nighttime frontal assaults on the U.S. defenses . The main Japanese assault occurred around <unk> ridge south of Henderson Field , manned by troops from several U.S. Marine Corps units , primarily troops from the 1st <unk> and 1st Parachute Battalions under U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. <unk> . Although the Marine defenses were almost overrun , <unk> 's attack was ultimately defeated , with heavy losses for the Japanese . 
 Because of the key participation by <unk> 's unit in defending the ridge , the ridge was commonly referred to as " <unk> 's " ridge in historical accounts of the battle in Western sources . After <unk> 's Ridge , the Japanese continued to send troops to <unk> for further attempts to retake Henderson Field , affecting Japanese offensive operations in other areas of the South Pacific .

 On 7 August 1942 , Allied forces ( primarily U.S. ) landed on <unk> , <unk> , and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands . The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia . They were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul and support the Allied New Guinea campaign . The landings initiated the six @-@ month @-@ long <unk> campaign . 
 Taking the Japanese by surprise , by nightfall on 8 August the Allied landing forces had secured <unk> and nearby small islands , as well as an airfield under construction at <unk> Point ( 9 ° 25 ′ 45 ″ S 160 ° 3 ′ 4 ″ E ) on the north shore of the island of <unk> east of the present day capital of <unk> . <unk> placed his 11 @,@ 000 troops of the 1st Marine Division on <unk> in a loose perimeter around the <unk> Point area . 
 On 12 August , the airfield was named Henderson Field after Major <unk> Henderson , a Marine <unk> who had been killed at the Battle of Midway . The Allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out of Henderson Field were called the " <unk> Air Force " after the Allied code name for <unk> . 
 In response to the Allied landings on <unk> , the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army 's 17th Army — a corps @-@ sized command based at Rabaul ( 4 ° 11 ′ 56 ″ S 152 ° 9 ′ 57 ″ E ) and under the command of Lieutenant @-@ General <unk> <unk> — with the task of retaking <unk> from Allied forces . The 17th Army — heavily involved with the Japanese campaign in New Guinea — had only a few units available to send to the southern <unk> area . Of these units , the 35th Infantry Brigade — under Major General <unk> <unk> — was at <unk> , the 4th ( <unk> ) Infantry Regiment was in the Philippines and the 28th ( <unk> ) Infantry Regiment — under the command of Colonel <unk> <unk> — was embarked on transport ships near Guam . The different units began to move toward <unk> immediately ; <unk> 's regiment — the closest — arrived first . The " First <unk> " of <unk> 's unit — consisting of about <unk> soldiers — landed from destroyers at <unk> Point ( 9 ° 24 ′ 38 ″ S 160 ° 20 ′ 56 ″ E ) , about 18 mi ( 29 km ) east of the <unk> perimeter , on August 19 . 
 <unk> the strength of Allied forces on <unk> , <unk> 's First <unk> conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at <unk> Creek on the east side of the <unk> perimeter in the early morning hours of August 21 . <unk> 's assault was repulsed with devastating losses for the attackers in what became known as the Battle of the <unk> : all but 128 of the <unk> men of the First <unk> ( including <unk> himself ) were killed in the battle . The survivors returned to <unk> Point , notified 17th Army headquarters of their defeat in the battle and awaited further reinforcements and orders from Rabaul . 
 By 23 August , <unk> 's unit had reached <unk> and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to <unk> . Because of the damage caused by Allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the Battle of the Eastern <unk> , the Japanese decided not to deliver <unk> 's troops to <unk> by slow transport ship ; instead , the ships carrying <unk> 's soldiers were sent to Rabaul . From there , the Japanese planned to deliver <unk> 's men to <unk> by destroyers , staging through a Japanese naval base in the <unk> Islands . The Japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down " The <unk> " to <unk> and back in a single night , <unk> their exposure to Allied air attack . However , most of the soldiers ' heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , could not be taken to <unk> with them . These high @-@ speed destroyer runs to <unk> , which occurred throughout the campaign , were later called the " Tokyo Express " by Allied forces and " Rat Transportation " by the Japanese . The Japanese controlled the seas around the Solomon Islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the Allies . However , any Japanese ship remaining within the 200 mi ( 320 km ) range of the aircraft at Henderson Field in daylight was in great danger from air attacks . This " curious tactical situation " held for several months . 
 
 = = = <unk> movement = = = 
 
 On 28 August , 600 of <unk> 's troops were loaded onto the destroyers <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , designated Destroyer Division 20 ( <unk> ) . Because of a shortage of fuel , <unk> could not make the entire round trip to <unk> at high speed in one night , but had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning at a slower speed which <unk> fuel . At 18 : 05 that day , 11 U.S. dive bombers from <unk> @-@ 232 under the command of Lt. Col. Richard <unk> , flew from Henderson Field and located and attacked <unk> about 70 mi ( 110 km ) north of <unk> , sinking <unk> and heavily damaging <unk> and <unk> . <unk> took <unk> in tow and the three destroyers returned to the <unk> without completing their mission . The attack on <unk> killed 62 of <unk> 's soldiers and 94 crew members . 
 Subsequent " Express " runs were more successful . Between 29 August and 4 September , various Japanese light cruisers , destroyers , and patrol boats were able to land almost 5 @,@ 000 troops at <unk> Point , including all of the 35th Infantry Brigade , one battalion of the <unk> Regiment , and the rest of <unk> 's regiment . General <unk> , who landed at <unk> Point on the 31 August Express run , was placed in command of all the Japanese troops on <unk> . On the night of 4 / 5 September , as three of the Express destroyers — <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> — prepared to shell Henderson Field after landing their troops , they detected and sank two U.S. ships in the vicinity , the small , old destroyer transports ( called " <unk> " by the U.S. Marines ) USS Little and Gregory that were used to <unk> Allied troops around the <unk> / <unk> area . 
 In spite of the successes of the destroyer runs , <unk> insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to <unk> by slow barges . Therefore , a convoy carrying 1 @,@ 100 of <unk> 's troops and heavy equipment in 61 barges , mainly from the 2nd Battalion , <unk> Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel <unk> <unk> , departed the northern coast of Santa Isabel Island on 2 September . On 4 – 5 September , aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the barge convoy , killing about 90 of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit 's heavy equipment . Most of the remaining 1 @,@ 000 troops were able to land near <unk> ( 9 ° 15 ′ 32 ″ S 159 ° 40 ′ 18 ″ E ) , west of the <unk> perimeter over the next few days . By 7 September , <unk> had 5 @,@ 200 troops at <unk> Point and 1 @,@ 000 west of the <unk> perimeter . <unk> was confident enough that he could defeat the Allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the 17th Army for delivery of one more infantry battalion to augment his forces . <unk> believed that there were only about 2 @,@ 000 U.S. Marines on <unk> . 
 During this time , <unk> continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses of the <unk> perimeter . Between 21 August and 3 September , he relocated three Marine battalions — including the 1st <unk> Battalion , under U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. <unk> ( <unk> 's Raiders ) , and the 1st Parachute Battalion — from <unk> and <unk> to <unk> . These units added about 1 @,@ 500 troops to <unk> 's original 11 @,@ 000 men defending Henderson Field . The 1st Parachute battalion , which had suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of <unk> and <unk> @-@ <unk> in August , was placed under <unk> 's command .

 <unk> set the date for his attack on the <unk> perimeter for 12 September and began marching his forces west from <unk> towards <unk> Point on 5 September . He <unk> 17th Army and requested that it carry out air strikes on Henderson Field beginning on 9 September , and that naval warships be stationed off <unk> Point on September 12 to " destroy any Americans who attempted to flee from the island . " On 7 September , <unk> issued his attack plan to " <unk> and <unk> the enemy in the vicinity of the <unk> Island airfield . " <unk> 's plan called for his forces to split into three , approach the <unk> perimeter inland , and launch a surprise night attack . <unk> 's force would attack the perimeter from the west while <unk> 's Second <unk> — renamed the <unk> Battalion — would attack from the east . The main attack would be by <unk> 's " Center Body " , numbering 3 @,@ 000 men in three battalions , from the south of the <unk> perimeter . By 7 September , most of <unk> 's troops had started marching from <unk> towards <unk> Point along the coastline . About 250 Japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade 's supply base at <unk> . 
 Meanwhile , native island scouts — directed by British government official and officer in the British Solomon Islands <unk> Defence Force , Martin <unk> — told the Marines of Japanese troops at <unk> , near the village of <unk> , about 17 mi ( 27 km ) east of <unk> . <unk> launched a raid against the Japanese troops at <unk> . Destroyer transports USS McKean and <unk> and two patrol boats took <unk> of <unk> 's men to <unk> in two trips . <unk> and his first wave of <unk> troops landed at <unk> at 05 : 20 ( local time ) on 8 September . <unk> by aircraft from Henderson Field and gunfire from the destroyer transports , <unk> 's men advanced towards <unk> village but were slowed by Japanese resistance . At 11 : 00 , the rest of <unk> 's men landed . With this reinforcement and more support from the Henderson Field aircraft , <unk> 's force pushed into the village . The Japanese defenders , believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an Allied supply ship convoy heading towards <unk> Point , retreated into the jungle , leaving behind 27 dead . Two Marines were killed . 
 In <unk> , <unk> 's troops discovered the supply base for <unk> 's forces , including large <unk> of food , ammunition and medical supplies , and a <unk> radio . The Marines seized documents , equipment and food supplies , destroyed the rest , and returned to the <unk> perimeter at 17 : 30 . The quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least 3 @,@ 000 Japanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack . 
 <unk> and Colonel Gerald Thomas , <unk> 's operations officer , believed that the Japanese attack would come at the <unk> Ridge , a narrow , grassy , 1 @,@ 000 m ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) long , coral ridge ( 9 ° 26 ′ 39 ″ S 160 ° 2 ′ 50 ″ E ) parallel to the <unk> River just south of Henderson Field . The ridge offered a natural <unk> of approach to the airfield , commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended . <unk> and Thomas tried to persuade <unk> to move forces to defend the ridge , but <unk> refused , believing that the Japanese were more likely to attack along the coast . Finally , Thomas convinced <unk> that the ridge was a good location for <unk> 's Raiders to " rest " from their actions of the preceding month . On 11 September , the 840 men of <unk> 's unit — including the 1st Raiders and the <unk> — deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it . 
 <unk> 's Center Body of troops was planning to attack the <unk> perimeter at the ridge , which they called " the <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> ) because of its shape . On 9 September , <unk> 's troops left the coast at <unk> Point . <unk> into four columns , they marched into the jungle towards their <unk> attack points south and southeast of the airfield . <unk> of good maps , at least one faulty <unk> , and thick , almost impenetrable jungle caused the Japanese columns to proceed slowly and <unk> , costing a lot of time . At the same time , <unk> 's troops approached the <unk> perimeter from the west . <unk> had some intelligence on the Marine defenses , extracted from a U.S. Army pilot captured on 30 August . 
 During the day of 12 September , <unk> 's troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night 's attacks . <unk> wanted his three Center Body battalions in place by 14 : 00 , but they did not reach their assembly areas until after 22 : 00 . <unk> was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west . Only the <unk> battalion reported that they were in place on time . Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions , <unk> was still confident in his attack plan because a captured U.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses . Japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on 11 – 12 September , causing a few casualties , including two killed .
